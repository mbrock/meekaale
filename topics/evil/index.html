Rather, the world is evil from the beginning and evil sustains it. There's so much evil in the very foundation of the world that identifying a specific evil is almost a kind of propaganda that conceals evil's enormity. Energy, industry, technology, numbers and alphabets, birth and death, love, perception, agency: everything is suffused with evil. Our ability to carry out our daily lives without being overwhelmed by evil is itself, of course, evil.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
