There is a distinct physical sensation of change, which you recognize once you have experienced it. We call it a <a class="ref" href="/topics/body-shift">Body Shift</a>. When people have this even once, they no longer helplessly wonder for years whether they are changing or not.</blockquote><blockquote>There are no words in the language to describe the felt sense and its physical shifts. Therefore, I must give a name to that feeling of coming unstuck inside. I call it the <a class="ref" href="/topics/body-shift">Body Shift</a>. Not everybody feels the shift taking place specifically in the belly. It may seem to happen all over the body, or it might feel like a loosening in the chest, or it might be a relaxation of a tight throat. I call it <a class="ref" href="/topics/body-shift">Body Shift</a> mainly to suggest that it doesn’t happen in the mind. It is always, in some way, a physical sensation. You often can see it and hear it when it happens in somebody else. There may be a long audible sigh of relief, a sudden loosening of some tight facial grimace, a quick, comfortable relaxing in the posture.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
