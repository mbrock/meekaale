a "self-sufficient homestead" is very clearly an ecological relational participation in an enormous fabric of human and non-human outerness </p><p>we can cut and paste various identities there, for example:

"We are a <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a> only in contact, and conviviality, with what is not our <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a>." </p><p>in a way the past year has actually clarified our <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a>'s own inner reality as well as our relational embeddedness

for example there's something about selecting & ordering groceries online that really makes explicit and symbolic our "place in the city" </p><p>there is a sad fraying aspect of seeing our favorite smaller venues struggle and close

the nearby zero waste shop just closed, and we realize how dear it was to us, how much it played a role in our <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a>'s "being-in-the-world" </p><p>in my own life I also retreated from the city, and from the <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a>, down into my basement workshop, trying to create a world down there, trying to create a space for engaging with otherness in the form of tools, wood, and work </p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/uses-of-disorder">Uses of Disorder</a></h3><div><p>My thinking had no clarity until I realized that in the last decades the <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a> has appropriated the social functions and contacts that men once sought in the broader arena of the city.

Children are taught to direct their desire at a love-object, namely the mother, which is kept out of reach from them by a powerful law, embodied by the father. The result is the passive individual subject, who will turn up to work, obey the boss, compete with the neighbours, and consume an endless stream of commodities. Psychoanalysis plays the role of the police force of capitalism, tracking down psychological deviants and reforming them in the image of the good child and the good worker.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/domestic-cozy-3">üì∞ Domestic Cozy: 3</a></h3><div><blockquote>We can unpack it in somewhat more detail if we assume the default Zoomer social unit, irrespective of context, to be the <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a>. The term fam, which apparently originated in black culture a couple of decades ago, has in recent years crossed over into mainstream usage. I think the driver has probably been the Zoomer need for an overloaded notion of <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a>. The Zoomer experience of the world is a strong pack experience in an unflattened Hobbesian world. Zoomers navigate the world in <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a>-like fictive-kin groups to a relatively greater extent than older generations, because they were raised to believe that the world beyond <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a> is devolving into apocalyptic chaos (which may or may not be true).</blockquote><blockquote>If Millennials act like they‚Äôre always in public, performing for an imagined audience, and Gen Xers act like they‚Äôre solitary, invisible, cyberpunk antiheroes hacking their way through futuristic technology-stack underbellies, Zoomers act like they‚Äôre always at home with <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a>, with the concomitant expectations of safety, intimacy, and trust. When those expectations are stressed, they react the way families do under threat, with the aggression of <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a> members responding to a threat to one of their own.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/friendship-is-a-root-of-freedom">üì∞ Friendship Is a Root of Freedom</a></h3><div><blockquote>Over centuries, kinship would be enclosed within the nuclear <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a>, freedom within the individual, and values within morality and law. Together, these enclosures carve out a void for the ‚Äòfree individual‚Äô of modern capitalism: a sad and lonely fiction, walled-in by self-interest, and based on the ideal of a healthy, patriarchal, white, rational, property-owning man. This uprooted being sees his rootlessness‚Äîhis very incapacity to make and sustain transformative connections‚Äîas a feat of excellence.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/george-herbert-mead">üì∞ George Herbert Mead</a></h3><div><blockquote>New selves are generated as <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a> systems are transformed.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/marx-and-anti-oedipus-dot-on-desiring-ones-own-suppression-|-epoche-magazine">üì∞ Marx and ‚ÄúAnti-Oedipus.‚Äù on Desiring One‚Äôs Own Suppression | Epoch√© Magazine</a></h3><div><blockquote>‚ÄúThere is always an uncle from America; a brother who went bad; an aunt who took off with a military man; a cousin out of work, bankrupt, or a victim of the Crash; an anarchist grandfather; a grandmother in the hospital, crazy or senile.

Attendance at religious institutions is in precipitous decline. The same is true of membership in lodges, chambers of commerce, and sports leagues.

There is no ‚ÄòI‚Äô apart from these. To this it may be replied: what about my immortal soul? Surely in the eyes of God I am an individual, prior to and apart from my roles. This rejoinder embodies a misconception, which in part arises from a confusion between the Platonic notion of the soul and that of Catholic Christianity. For the Platonist, as later for the Cartesian, the soul, preceding all bodily and social existence, must indeed possess an identity prior to all social roles; but for the Catholic Christian, as earlier for the Aristotelian, the body and the soul are not two linked substances. I am my body and my body is social, born to those parents in this community with a specific social identity. What does make a difference for the Catholic Christian is that I, whatever earthly community I may belong to, am also held to be a member of a heavenly, eternal community in which I also have a role, a community represented on earth by the church.</blockquote><blockquote>I am someone‚Äôs son or daughter, someone else‚Äôs cousin or uncle; I am a citizen of this or that city, a member of this or that guild or profession; I belong to this clan, that tribe, this nation. Hence what is good for me has to be the good for one who inhabits these roles. As such, I inherit from the past of my <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a>, my city, my tribe, my nation, a variety of debts, inheritances, rightful expectations and obligations. These constitute the given of my life, my moral starting point.
