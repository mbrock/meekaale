In a broad and general sense, it wants to go somewhere. It wants to set things straight. It has a directionality, some rudimentary <a class="ref" href="/topics/telos">Telos</a>, an urge to cohere, persist, and flourish. Therapy ought to assist this innate yearning rather than impose some external schema.

Being good, according to Aristotle, consists in a creature (whether plant, animal, or human) acting according to its <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>â€”its <a class="ref" href="/topics/telos">Telos</a>, or purpose. The <a class="ref" href="/topics/telos">Telos</a> for human beings is to generate a communal life with others; and the good society is composed of many independent, self-reliant groups.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/after-virtue">ðŸ“™ After Virtue</a></h3><div><blockquote>There is no present which is not informed by some image of some future and an image of the future which always presents itself in the form of a <a class="ref" href="/topics/telos">Telos</a>â€”or of a variety of ends or goalsâ€”towards which we are either moving or failing to move in the present.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/crippled-grace">ðŸ“™ Crippled Grace</a></h3><div><blockquote>As noted earlier, while Aristotle and the New Testament have very different views about the good life and virtue, they share a logical and conceptual structure that identifies virtue with the achievement of the human <a class="ref" href="/topics/telos">Telos</a> (flourishing) and vice (sin) with its destruction.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/hyperobjects">ðŸ“™ Hyperobjects</a></h3><div><blockquote>The end of <a class="ref" href="/topics/teleology">Teleology</a> is the end of the world.
