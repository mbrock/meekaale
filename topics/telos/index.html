In a broad and general sense, it wants to go somewhere. It wants to set things straight. It has a directionality, some rudimentary <a class="ref" href="/topics/telos">Telos</a>, an urge to cohere, persist, and flourish. Therapy ought to assist this innate yearning rather than impose some external schema. We need to learn to listen to our own perceptions.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/macintyre-on-money---prospect-magazine"> MacIntyre on Money - Prospect Magazine</a></h3><div><blockquote>MacIntyre’s key moral and political idea is that to be human is to be an Aristotelian goal-driven, social animal. Being good, according to Aristotle, consists in a creature (whether plant, animal, or human) acting according to its <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>—its <a class="ref" href="/topics/telos">Telos</a>, or purpose. The <a class="ref" href="/topics/telos">Telos</a> for human beings is to generate a communal life with others; and the good society is composed of many independent, self-reliant groups.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a></h3><div><blockquote>There is no present which is not informed by some image of some future and an image of the future which always presents itself in the form of a <a class="ref" href="/topics/telos">Telos</a>—or of a variety of ends or goals—towards which we are either moving or failing to move in the present.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/crippled-grace"> Crippled Grace</a></h3><div><blockquote>As noted earlier, while Aristotle and the New Testament have very different views about the good life and virtue, they share a logical and conceptual structure that identifies virtue with the achievement of the human <a class="ref" href="/topics/telos">Telos</a> (flourishing) and vice (sin) with its destruction.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/hyperobjects"> Hyperobjects</a></h3><div><blockquote>The end of <a class="ref" href="/topics/teleology">Teleology</a> is the end of the world. This end is precisely not an instant vaporization, but rather a lingering coexistence with strange strangers. For the end of the world is the end of endings, the end of <a class="ref" href="/topics/telos">Telos</a>, and the beginning of an uncertain, hesitating futurality.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/reading-alasdair-macintyres-after-virtue"> Reading Alasdair MacIntyre’s After Virtue</a></h3><div><blockquote>Given the constraints of enlightenment thought, specifically its rejection of any fixed goal or <a class="ref" href="/topics/telos">Telos</a> of human life, these three approaches seem to exhaust the possibilities, and all three have failed to justify the authority of moral rules over the lives of human agents.</blockquote><blockquote>with the moral freedom to act on that judgment. With the rejection of the concept of a natural end or <a class="ref" href="/topics/telos">Telos</a> for the human person, the virtues become indefinite, for they lose the criteria that had determined their meaning and content.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
