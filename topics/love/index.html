And what can happen then? What can life do with this heap of half-broken things that they call their communion and that they would like to call their happiness, if that were possible, and their future? And so each of them loses himself for the sake of the other person, and loses the other, and many others who still wanted to come.</blockquote><blockquote>This advance (at first very much against the will of the outdistanced men) will transform the <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> experience, which is now filled with error, will change it from the ground up, and reshape it into a relationship that is meant to be between one human being and another, no longer one that flows from man to woman. And this more human <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> (which will fulfill itself with infinite consideration and gentleness, and kindness and clarity in binding and releasing) will resemble what we are now preparing painfully and with great struggle: the <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> that consists in this: that two solitudes protect and border and greet each other.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/the-long-path-that-leads-from-the-making-of-our-world-to-god">📰 The Long Path that Leads from the Making of Our World to God</a></h3><div><p>And it is in this way that I was led from architecture to the intellectual knowledge and <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> of God. </p><p>**In effect we began to discover a new kind of empirical complex in buildings and works of art that is connected with the human self, God, spirituality, social and mental health, and ways of understanding the role that <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> plays in establishing wholeness, the role of art, and conscious awareness of the human being as part of some greater spiritual entity.**</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/all-things-shining">📙 All Things Shining</a></h3><div><blockquote>To put the phenomenon in Christian terms we could say: God the father, with his mood of righteousness, is the Hebrew background practices on the basis of which anything makes sense; God the Son is the paradigm who shows a life that gathers the practices in a new way and manifests the new mood of agape <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a>; and the Holy Spirit is the shining new style of life that draws John and Paul, among others, to articulate the Christian way of life.</blockquote><blockquote>The City of Dis is a fortress instead of a prison because the souls who live within it have not just turned their <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> toward something less fulfilling than God; they have actively rejected Him.</blockquote><blockquote>Here my powers rest from their high fantasy But already I could feel my being turned … By the <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> that moves the Sun and the other stars.</blockquote><blockquote>Dante thinks that you should intensify your <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> and be committed to whatever attracts you with total devotion, and then if it fails to satisfy you, which it surely will, you can learn from your mistakes until you finally find someone or something worthy of total passion and commitment. The last thing you should do is trim your desire. Free will allows you to train your desires in the right direction.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/crippled-grace">📙 Crippled Grace</a></h3><div><blockquote>Jesus teaches and then embodies a solution to the problem of evil: the divine <a class="ref" href="/topics/choice">Choice</a> to submit to the injustice and suffering of the cross, and transform the evil done to him into a good by responding with <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> and forgiveness.</blockquote><blockquote>In a deliberate interplay with philosophy, St. Paul regularly contrasted the foolishness of the gospel with the wisdom of the Greeks. That foolishness was a seemingly upside-down vision of the good life that took the form of self-sacrificing <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> for God and neighbor, and more radically again, <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> of one’s enemies (an impossibility for <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>).</blockquote><blockquote>The New Testament contains some striking contrasts with <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>’s analysis of virtue. In particular, it praises virtues that <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> knows nothing about—faith, hope, and <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a>—and counts as virtues qualities that <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> treats as vice, such as <a class="ref" href="/topics/humility">Humility</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>Aquinas notes that sin causes us to be double minded, lacking internal integration, so that we are at war within ourselves (cf. Rom 7:14-26). Internal integration, for Aquinas, is ultimately a result of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> of God, since one is at <a class="ref" href="/topics/peace">Peace</a> with oneself when loving God wholeheartedly, and thereafter is able to <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> others fully.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/prayer">📙 Prayer</a></h3><div><blockquote>Here, I believe, is the key to understanding what is most personal in prayer. We do not pray to tell God what he does not know, nor to remind him of things he has forgotten. He already cares for the things we pray about … He has simply been waiting for us to care about them with him. When we pray, we stand by God and look with him toward those people and problems. When we lift our eyes from them toward him, we do so with loving praise, just as we look toward our oldest and dearest friends and tell them how we care for them, though they already know it … We speak to him as we speak to our most intimate friends – so that we can commune together in <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a>.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/scattered-minds">📙 Scattered Minds</a></h3><div><blockquote>Throughout this book, I have insisted on the connection between human relationship and attention. <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a>, it turns out, is intimately related to attention.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/self-therapy">📙 Self-Therapy</a></h3><div><blockquote>The Self is connected to the deeper ground of being that spiritual teachings speak of, sometimes called God. It has access to a kind of higher wisdom and understanding that can guide you in dealing with the larger questions of life. It allows you to be fully present and embodied in each moment with aliveness and depth. It is an inexhaustible fountain of <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a>.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-art-of-loving">📙 The Art of Loving</a></h3><div><blockquote>In contrast to symbiotic union, mature love is union under the condition of preserving one’s integrity, one’s individuality. Love is an active power in man; a power which breaks through the walls which separate man from his fellow men, which unites him with others; love makes him overcome the sense of isolation and separateness, yet it permits him to be himself, to retain his integrity. In <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> the paradox occurs that two beings become one and yet remain two.</blockquote><blockquote>One of the most significant expressions of <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a>, and especially of marriage with this alienated structure, is the idea of the “team.” In any number of articles on happy marriage, the ideal described is that of the smoothly functioning team.</blockquote><blockquote>In this concept of <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> and marriage the main emphasis is on finding a refuge from an otherwise unbearable sense of aloneness. In “love” one has found, at last, a haven from aloneness. One forms an alliance of two against the world, and this egoism à deux is mistaken for love and intimacy.</blockquote><blockquote>Just as it is customary for people to believe that pain and sadness should be avoided under all circumstances, they believe that <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> means the absence of any conflict.</blockquote><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> is possible only if two persons communicate with each other from the center of their existence, hence if each one of them experiences himself from the center of his existence.</blockquote><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a>, experienced thus, is a constant challenge; it is not a resting place, but a moving, growing, working together; even whether there is harmony or conflict, joy or sadness, is secondary to the fundamental fact that two people experience themselves from the essence of their existence, that they are one with each other by being one with themselves, rather than by fleeing from themselves.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-second-person-perspective-in-aquinass-ethics">📙 The Second-Person Perspective in Aquinas’s Ethics</a></h3><div><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> is the super-virtue or transcendent virtue of Aquinas’s entire network of perfective attributes.</blockquote><blockquote>Aquinas claims that <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> is included in the definition of every virtue, not as being essentially every virtue, but because every virtue depends on it.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
