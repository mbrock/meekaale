In all these cases, exactly as with those forgotten snapshots, your body knows much that you don’t know, much that you cannot possibly figure out.</blockquote><blockquote>Nameless horrors and weird states are not lying there “<a class="ref" href="/topics/inside">Inside</a>” you, like poisonous snakes locked in a cage. Many people talk of themselves this way. “I don’t want to open the lid,” they say. “I don’t want to let all that bad stuff come out.” The truth is that you are not a cage full of snakes. You are not any kind of container in which feelings writhe around with lives of their own. You are a process, and your feelings are a part of that process.</blockquote><blockquote>Our structured institutions today offer little opportunity for personal living and speaking. The real living of people is mostly dulled and silent, <a class="ref" href="/topics/inside">Inside</a> them, alone. In terms of social institutions, that space is empty.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/scattered-minds">📙 Scattered Minds</a></h3><div><blockquote>With all these self-parenting tasks, the catch-22 for the ADD adult is that the very state he is wanting to grow out of hinders his capacity to create the conditions required for growth. In order to settle the chaos <a class="ref" href="/topics/inside">Inside</a>, we have to clear up the chaos outside, which was generated in the first place by the chaos <a class="ref" href="/topics/inside">Inside</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>When they look <a class="ref" href="/topics/inside">Inside</a> themselves, they discover a frightening emptiness, a vacuum, an absence of a true self or of intrinsic motivation. Many a time I have heard ADD adults say, “I don’t know who I am,” or, “I don’t know what I want to do in my life.”</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/self-therapy">📙 Self-Therapy</a></h3><div><blockquote>Since parts are like little people <a class="ref" href="/topics/inside">Inside</a> you, you can make contact with them, get to know them, negotiate with them, encourage them to trust you, help them communicate with each other, and give them what they need to heal.</blockquote><blockquote>Exiles often take on the beliefs or the feeling tone of your family. If your family life was chaotic, you will probably have an exile that feels jumbled <a class="ref" href="/topics/inside">Inside</a>.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
