Taking production in our hands, we shall destroy not a single <a class="ref" href="/topics/machine">Machine</a> nor damage a single lever. We shall not abandon our factories and plants nor replace them with an idyllic life in huts in fields and forests under the open sky.</blockquote><blockquote>On the contrary, we shall bring our liberated energy to the factory. We shall imbue our <a class="ref" href="/topics/machine">Machine</a>s with new power. We shall build as yet unheard-of giants from concrete, glass and steel. We shall raise industry to new and untouched heights. Our cities shall not be broken up and dispersed. Rather they will blossom with gardens, and additional millions of people will joyously fill their sunlit streets.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/conceptual-engineering-the-revolution-in-philosophy-youve-never-heard-of---lesswrong">📰 Conceptual Engineering: The Revolution in Philosophy You've Never Heard of - LessWrong</a></h3><div><blockquote>CogSci's current best guess about human intelligence, a guess popularly known as predictive processing, theorizes that the brain is a <a class="ref" href="/topics/machine">Machine</a> for detecting regularities in the world—think similarities of property or effect, rhythms in the sense of sequence, conjunction e.g. temporal or spatial—and compressing them</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/shop-class-as-soulcraft">📰 Shop Class as Soulcraft</a></h3><div><blockquote>As Lears tells the story, the great irony is that antimodernist sentiments of aesthetic revolt against the <a class="ref" href="/topics/machine">Machine</a> paved the way for certain unattractive features of late-modern culture: therapeutic self-absorption and the hankering after “authenticity,” precisely those psychic hooks now relied upon by advertisers. Such spiritualized, symbolic modes of craft practice and craft consumption represented a kind of compensation for, and therefore an accommodation to, new modes of routinized, bureaucratic work.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/alien-phenomenology-or-what-its-like-to-be-a-thing">📙 Alien Phenomenology, or What It's Like to Be a Thing</a></h3><div><blockquote>The phenomenologist who performs carpentry creates a <a class="ref" href="/topics/machine">Machine</a> that tries to replicate the unit operation of another’s experience. Like a space probe sent out to record, process, and report information, the alien phenomenologist’s carpentry seeks to capture and characterize an experience it can never fully understand, offering a rendering satisfactory enough to allow the artifact’s operator to gain some insight into an alien thing’s experience.
