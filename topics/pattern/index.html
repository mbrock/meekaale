From <a class="ref" href="/topics/the-timeless-way-of-building">The Timeless Way of Building</a>:</p><blockquote>A pulsating, fluid, but nonetheless definite entity swims in your mind’s eye. It is a geometrical image, it is far more than the knowledge of the problem; it is the knowledge of the problem, coupled with the knowledge of the kinds of geometrics which will solve the problem, and coupled with the feeling which is created by that kind of geometry solving that problem. It is, above all, a feeling—a morphological feeling. This morphological feeling, which cannot be exactly stated, but can only be crudely hinted at by any one precise formulation, is at the heart of every <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>The search for a name is a fundamental part of the process of inventing or discovering a <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>. So long as a <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a> has a weak name, it means that it is not a clear concept, and you cannot clearly tell me to make “one” [...] But it is very hard to be precise. Even once you are determined to do it it is terribly hard to make precise statements which really get to the heart of the matter.</blockquote><p>Juxtaposing Eugene Gendlin and Christopher Alexander, I had an initial felt sense that they had something in common, and I think I got a handle on why. They’re both “healers” who see the body as a source of teleological wisdom. They think the world will be better when we learn to heal ourselves and our environments, making continual reference to dimly perceived signals of goodness and beauty, allowing ourselves to attend quietly and sensitively to the knots and errors we feel in our bodies and in the world, learning to craft new <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>s to resolve these tensions and share these in communities of practice. And they see the world as it is today as lacking in this kind of sensitivity, leading to a dullness and deadness in the social and built environments.</p><blockquote>Our structured institutions today offer little opportunity for personal living and speaking.

New forms that are equally fixed and painful? New forms can come from inside each person instead of being imposed from outside.

It will be a world in which forms are used in a new way.</blockquote><blockquote>Many people today are struggling with a baffling fact: The old <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>s that are supposed to make life work—and once did—no longer serve. Being a parent today, for example, doesn’t work if we try to do it as our parents did, yet no other form is established for us to follow. We have to make it up as we go along— often learning that what we just did was wrong.</blockquote><blockquote>Similarly, some women find the housewife role empty and intolerable, but are often unprepared for anything else even if they know what it might be. The <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a> of being a woman is changing, but people argue whether it is changing into this or that new <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>, as if eventually, somehow, a fixed form must be imposed.</blockquote><blockquote>These old <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>s once were useful. The mass of people (always with odd exceptions) fitted themselves into the roles and routines they were assigned and which gave them an inner life of emotions. Only a small number of educated and thinking people created roles and <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>s. But today this dependence on routines and roles has changed. A large part of the mass of people are educated and literate. The creativity and creative needs of people have expanded, and now the routines are too confining. People find that they have feelings that are far more complex than accepted roles either demand or offer.</blockquote><blockquote>Focusing is only a piece of an answer.

It can be a source of new <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>s, devised freshly by each individual.</blockquote><blockquote>Instead of having only the predictable, expected emotions the roles call for, we often have unclear feelings. They are unclear because “clear” feelings are those that are already <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>ed. We must make new phrases to express these unclear feelings, and new forms of action to carry the feelings into daily life.

Agent-centred ethics, on the other hand, focus on long-term characteristic <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>s of action, intentionally downplaying atomic acts and particular <a class="ref" href="/topics/choice">Choice</a> situations in the process.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-nature-of-order">📙 The Nature of Order</a></h3><div><blockquote>But something far more important was also happening. The piece of information unloosed the possibility of feelings which people had, but were not aware they had. Many people do not experience what they feel, because they are cut off from it. The deeper and more vulnerable feeling that arises in them as they approach the I, especially, may be unavailable to their experience.

They do not necessarily recognize it in themselves when it is happening, sometimes do not experience it at all. But, with an intellectual focus which places attention on the alcove <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>, a person could become aware—in thinking about an alcove, or seeing one, or experiencing one in use—of the subtle feeling of this one kind, which wells up in those who are related to the existence of the alcove, and make them aware, too, of its non-existence, in a room where possibilities of intimacy are missing.

The effect, then, is an awareness of intimacy as a feature of space, and an awareness of the link that exists between this feeling and the physical geometry of the environment. Thus the person becomes conscious of a more rounded and deeper relation between the shape of the physical world, even the existence of the physical world, and the evolution of their own emotions and feelings during daily life. </blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-practice-of-everyday-life">📙 The Practice of Everyday Life</a></h3><div><blockquote>Place de 1'Etoile, Concorde, Poissonniere...

There is, he argues, an affective tonality, a mode of conveying meaning beneath the level of thought, beneath the level of the words themselves … which is contained in the words just insofar as they are <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>ed sounds, as just the sounds which this particular historical language uniquely uses, and which are much more like a melody—a ‘singing of the world’—than fully translatable, conceptual thought. Merleau-Ponty is almost alone among philosophers of language in his sensitivity to this level of meaning.…3</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
