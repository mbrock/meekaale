But this created thing contains within itself the process of its own creation, the system of production and reproduction by which it comes into being, sustains and perpetuates itself. It is civilization conceived in this way—not as a stable and completed object to be <a class="ref" href="/topics/external">External</a>ly assessed in its freestanding activity but as something that seems at once <a class="ref" href="/topics/interior">Interior</a> to that thing, the process residing within it that brings it about, and yet <a class="ref" href="/topics/exterior">Exterior</a> to the thing, the vast artifact in which all other artifacts (pitchers, plates, cities, and systems, all objects collectively designated “civilization”) are made and modified—that is Marx’s subject.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
