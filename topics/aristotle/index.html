Nietzsche or <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>?</blockquote><blockquote>12. <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s Account of the Virtues</blockquote><blockquote>18. After Virtue: Nietzsche or <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>, Trotsky and St. Benedict</blockquote><blockquote>Moral philosophies, however they may aspire to achieve more than this, always do articulate the morality of some particular social and cultural standpoint: <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> is the spokesman for one class of fourth century Athenians, Kant, as I have already noticed, provides a rational voice for the emerging social forces of liberal individualism.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/crippled-grace">üìô Crippled Grace</a></h3><div><blockquote>As developed by <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>, eudaimonia is teleological‚Äîit is the end we pursue for its own sake and nothing else.10 We act for many reasons, with many ends or purposes in mind, but all of these ends aim for the ultimate purpose of living a good life, which is eudaimonia‚Äîhappiness.</blockquote><blockquote>For <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>, though, what makes us distinctly human is our capacity for reasoning, so that only a person who lives wisely (wisdom is practical reasoning) can be said to have lived a fully human life.</blockquote><blockquote>If eudaimonia is understood as the flourishing life, <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> argues that it is virtuous activity that achieves it. A virtue is a characteristic or trait‚Äîa habit of character‚Äîthat enables a person to succeed in their undertakings and, more broadly, to flourish in life.</blockquote><blockquote>The recognition that there is an internal reward that comes from acting virtuously leads <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> to differentiate between a person who is self-controlled (or continent) and one who is fully virtuous. The former knows what to do and does it, even though it is contrary to her desires, and so exercises self-control when she acts.24 The latter knows what to do and desires to do it, and so acts with full virtue.</blockquote><blockquote>Transcending the moral virtues are what <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> describes as the ‚Äúintellectual capacities of the soul.‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote>It is this contemplative capacity that <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> believes is most distinctly human, and so for him, it is the intellectual virtues of the philosopher that facilitate complete happiness.</blockquote><blockquote>The best friendships are only possible between people of equal virtue and, according to <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>, equal advantage, and are characterized by the joy of living together. Such relationships enable people to achieve their own good by acting in the interest of the other.</blockquote><blockquote>The importance of friendship for the flourishing of people with disabilities warrants further attention, especially given <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>‚Äôs view that true friendship is only possible between people of equal advantage.</blockquote><blockquote>Reflecting the prejudices of his day, <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> thus concludes that women and slaves are unable to be happy, in the fullest sense of the term, because they lack the freedom to make their own decisions, which restricts their exercise of virtue. ‚ÄúThe slave is completely without the deliberative element; the female has it, but it has no authority.‚Äù30 More than just the cultural blindness of this position, what is noteworthy for our purposes is that this logic is extended by <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> to people who are chronically ill, mentally deficient, and even ‚Äúugly.‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote>For <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>, ill health, mental deficiency, and ugliness‚Äîcharacteristic ways of describing disability‚Äîare not only undesirable for their own sake (how could anyone consider the disabled life to be a good life?) but necessarily restrict the full exercise of virtue.</blockquote><blockquote>And so we come to the crux of the matter. For <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> it is impossible for the disabled person to be truly happy. This prejudice cannot be brushed aside, since it indicates one of the problems of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a>, which is the tendency for virtue to be conceived of in ways that entrench the status quo.</blockquote><blockquote>But <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>, as an elite Greek, is unable to see the dark side of life with the same perspicuity as the authors of the scriptures, and this is important for disability. The author of Ecclesiastes speaks to the disempowered condition, and ‚Äúthe hedonic joy he describes could be seen as an important act of resistance against oppressive conditions, since he refuses to let the human spirit be crushed.‚Äù45 This refusal gets to the heart of what disability pride and empowerment are all about.</blockquote><blockquote>In a deliberate interplay with philosophy, St.¬†Paul regularly contrasted the foolishness of the gospel with the wisdom of the Greeks. That foolishness was a seemingly upside-down vision of the good life that took the form of self-sacrificing <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> for God and neighbor, and more radically again, <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> of one‚Äôs enemies (an impossibility for <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>).</blockquote><blockquote>With the foundation of grace in place, St.¬†Paul insists that the Spirit of God will help to set our minds on Christ (Rom 8:1-17), so that imitating his self-sacrificing love becomes habitual. Indeed, the fruit of the Spirit (Gal 5:19-25) is not ethical rule-keeping but a transformed character, and love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (vv. 21-22) are virtues. And like <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>‚Äôs fully virtuous man, the virtuous life modeled on Jesus becomes something that Christians do gladly (2¬†Cor 12:9, 15), so that happiness and virtue go hand in hand.</blockquote><blockquote>The New Testament contains some striking contrasts with <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>‚Äôs analysis of virtue. In particular, it praises virtues that <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> knows nothing about‚Äîfaith, hope, and <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a>‚Äîand counts as virtues qualities that <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> treats as vice, such as humility.</blockquote><blockquote>MacIntyre holds that <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> would not have admired Jesus Christ, and would have been horrified by St.¬†Paul.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/learning-from-macintyre">üìô Learning From MacIntyre</a></h3><div><blockquote>This important form of knowing, according to <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>, is available only to those who have already been well brought up. Prior to acquiring this knowledge there was, in youth, a special form of education‚Äîhabituation into good practices that organized the non-rational parts of the soul so as to put the person in a position to respond well to what reason later came to understand. The lectures of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/nicomachean-ethics">Nicomachean Ethics</a> are meant to be a completion and perfection of the training that has gone before.</blockquote><blockquote>This is the modern-day counterpart of being born into a bad polis. <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>, as MacIntyre points out, did have an interest in how a bad upbringing and a bad polis misshapes the souls, and thus the outlooks, of those who are on the receiving end.1024 But <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>‚Äôs studies of those unfortunate cases were not meant to be of practical benefit for those unfortunates.</blockquote><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> repeatedly insists that the right words‚Äîthe words of ethical and political virtue‚Äîin the mouths of the immature, the badly brought up, the dissolute, the drunk, the akratic‚Äîwill be empty.</blockquote><blockquote>Somehow the words would have to get through to us in our psychically damaged state and help us, in some way, in the midst of that damage. There is no such procedure in <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>. For him, ethical education moves in one direction: the lectures come after the habituated ethical training and healthy formation of the non-rational soul.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/philosophy-and-the-mirror-of-nature">üìô Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature</a></h3><div><blockquote>So even <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>, who spent his life pouring cold water on the metaphysical extravagances of his predecessors, suggests that there probably is something to the notion that the intellect is ‚Äúseparable,‚Äù even though nothing else about the soul is.</blockquote><blockquote>The powers manifested by Achilles were not those of Theaetetus or the Apostles or St. Thomas, but the ‚Äúintellectual essence‚Äù of the scholastics inherited the dualistic notions which gathered force between Homer and Anaxagoras, were given canonical form by Plato, were toned down by <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>, and then became entangled (in St. Paul) with a new and determinedly other-worldly religious cult.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
