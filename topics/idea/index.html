It tracks my overall mood and agency in a sawtooth pattern. I trim it and restore an adequate sense of self, but because I yearn for a full and healthy Iron & Wine lion's mane I let it grow out again. What manifests is only an increasingly irritating scraggle that I can't stop touching. When I eventually find the wisdom to trim it back again, it doesn't feel like a victory but an eternally returning defeat.</p><div class="indent"></div><h3>Quotes from Scattered Minds</h3><div class="indent"></div><p>From Gabor Maté's <a class="ref" href="/books/scattered-minds"> Scattered Minds</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>People with ADD are hypersensitive. That is not a fault or a weakness of theirs, it is how they were born. It is their inborn temperament. That, primarily, is what is hereditary about ADD. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>I do not believe ADD leads to creativity any more than creativity causes ADD. Rather, they both originate in the same inborn trait: sensitivity. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Since emotionally hypersensitive reactions are no less physiological than the body’s allergic responses to physical substances, we may say truthfully that people with ADD have emotional allergies. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>People with ADD are forever told that they are “too sensitive” or that they should stop being “so touchy.” One might as well advise a child with hay fever to stop being “so allergic.” <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>With all these self-parenting tasks, the catch-22 for the ADD adult is that the very state he is wanting to grow out of hinders his capacity to create the conditions required for growth. In order to settle the chaos inside, we have to clear up the chaos outside, which was generated in the first place by the chaos inside. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section><section><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/idea">Idea</a></h3><div><p><strong>Idea</strong>: Think of <a class="ref" href="/topics/phenomenology">Phenomenology</a> as <a class="ref" href="/topics/antibureaucratic">Antibureaucratic</a>.</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
