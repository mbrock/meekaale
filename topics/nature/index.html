Being good, according to Aristotle, consists in a creature (whether plant, animal, or human) acting according to its <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>—its <a class="ref" href="/topics/telos">Telos</a>, or purpose. The <a class="ref" href="/topics/telos">Telos</a> for human beings is to generate a communal life with others; and the good society is composed of many independent, self-reliant groups.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/a-rumor-of-angels">📙 A Rumor of Angels</a></h3><div><blockquote>Instead, let us look at the ordinary world, which some philosophers have called the Lebenswelt, or “life-world,” within which we carry on our “normal” activities in collaboration with other men. This is the arena of most of our projects in life, whose reality is strongest and thus the most “natural” in our consciousness. This, in the words of the social philosopher Alfred Schutz, is “the world of daily life which the wide-awake, grown-up man who acts in it and upon it amidst his fellow-man experiences within the natural attitude as a reality.” It is to this domain of taken-for-granted, “natural” experience (not necessarily to “n<a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a> in the sense of, say, the eighteenth-century rationalists) that religion posits a “<a class="ref" href="/topics/supernatural">Supernatural</a>” reality.</blockquote><blockquote>It is to this domain of taken-for-granted, “natural” experience (not necessarily to “<a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>” in the sense of, say, the eighteenth-century rationalists) that religion posits a “<a class="ref" href="/topics/supernatural">Supernatural</a>” reality.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/being-in-the-world">📙 Being-In-The-World</a></h3><div><blockquote>Being essentially self-interpreting, Dasein has no <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>.

Therefore, to account for the <a class="ref" href="/topics/equipment">Equipment</a>al whole in terms of occurrent elements, traditional <a class="ref" href="/topics/ontology">Ontology</a>, as developed by Descartes and still found in Husserlian phenomenology, information processing psychology, and Artificial Intelligence research, must supplement the bare things in <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a> that serve in the explanations provided by natural science, with function or value predicates.'</blockquote><blockquote>The world is what we directly understand and in terms of which one can see how <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>, <a class="ref" href="/topics/equipment">Equipment</a>, persons, etc. fit together and make sense.

What a phenomenological reflection on the experience of agency reveals beyond this, though, is that, to be such appropriately responsive agents, we must also grow as subjects; this growth, too, is one that we must actively participate in, as well as undergo. Agency, in short, is not naturally occurring, but is achieved—as Aristotle says about the polis, it is natural to us, but does not occur by <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>—and ethical agency is fundamentally a matter of undamaged development, itself predicated upon proper care.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/philosophy-and-social-hope">📙 Philosophy and Social Hope</a></h3><div><blockquote>The Romantics were inspired by the successes of antimonarchist and anticlericalist revolutions to think that the desire for something to obey is a symptom of immaturity. These successes made it possible to envisage building a new Jerusalem without divine assistance, thereby creating a society in which men and women would lead the perfected lives which had previously seemed possible only in an invisible, immaterial, post-mortem paradise. The image of progress toward such a society – horizontal progress, so to speak – began to take the place of Platonic or Dantean images of vertical ascent. History began to replace God, Reason and <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a> as the source of human hope.</blockquote><blockquote>After Darwin, however, it became possible to believe that <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a> is not leading up to anything – that <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a> has nothing in mind.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/reading-alasdair-macintyres-after-virtue">📙 Reading Alasdair MacIntyre’s After Virtue</a></h3><div><blockquote>From what we may call “the standpoint of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/common-good">Common Good</a>,” the standpoint of Plato, Aristotle, and Thomas Aquinas, the <a class="ref" href="/topics/common-good">Common Good</a> is not an aggregation of private interests, and it is not a formal or procedural good like justice or the right to due process. From this ancient and medieval standpoint, the <a class="ref" href="/topics/common-good">Common Good</a> is a substantive good that we can seek for ourselves only through participation in the life of the communities to which we belong; it is a good for each of us that we can all share, but only if we seek it together. This ancient and medieval standpoint of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/common-good">Common Good</a> views the human person as a political animal who belongs to a community neither by <a class="ref" href="/topics/choice">Choice</a> nor by accident, but by <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/scattered-minds">📙 Scattered Minds</a></h3><div><blockquote>There is matchless unity, harmony and peace in <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>—all that is lacking, in other words, in the ADD mind.

But it is clear we must embrace struggle. Every living thing conforms to it. Everything in <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a> grows and establishes itself in its own way, establishing its own identity, insisting on it at all cost, against all resistance. We can be sure of very little, but the need to court struggle is a surety that will not leave us. – RAINER MARIA RILKE, Letters to a Young Poet</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-nature-of-order">📙 The Nature of Order</a></h3><div><blockquote>The observations I have used to build a modified picture of space and matter are observations which are available to anyone. They are not, in themselves, very astonishing. Many of them were well known to traditional artisans and artists. But, precisely because the observational method of Descartes forbade us from seeing these observables, they have dropped out of awareness. It might be said (by an adherent of mechanistic thinking) that they must not be true, cannot be true, because if they were, something would be wrong with the machinelike representation of the universe. I, on the other hand, started with a different kind of observation. I knew, intuitively, that observation of the inner feeling in a work of building, and the fact that different works of art have more feeling or less feeling, is a real thing. I based my whole method of analysis on the observations that I got by following this method, and on the observables which this method exposes to view.

And since, within this method, there is no arbitrary prohibition against discovering a nonmechanical <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a> in the structure of space, I was able to consider and discover such a <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>.

Thus the characteristics of the field of <a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a> which make it potentially profoundwhich make it the basis of great art and building - were available to my inspection, only because I used a method of observation that allowed me to check the feeling of a work as an objective matter. </blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-spell-of-the-sensuous">📙 The Spell of the Sensuous</a></h3><div><blockquote>Only by overlooking the sensuous, evocative dimension of human discourse, and attending solely to the denotative and conventional aspect of verbal communication, can we hold ourselves apart from, and outside of, the rest of animate <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>With the advent of the aleph-beth, a new distance opens between human culture and the rest of <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>Ecologically considered, it is not primarily our verbal statements that are “true” or “false,” but rather the kind of relations that we sustain with the the rest of <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
