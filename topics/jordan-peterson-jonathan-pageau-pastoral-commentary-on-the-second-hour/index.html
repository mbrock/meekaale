I've been watching nerd of the rings lately. What a great channel. What a great channel! I love it. The power of the elves is that their rope is more ropey. It's stronger than knots hold, and AnAnd loosened that the clothes that the bread nourishes better the capes and the garments protect better and conceal better. Everything does. It's everything everything pursues its tell us better. That's the magic of the elves, that</p><p id="rOL05gryU">Speaker 1: an idea, can encounter the purpose and logos. And then then you have a chair. You can't have just a bunch of stuff or else you don't have a chair. You need that to meet. So at the center of every thing of everything that exists, there is a little temple and many temple. And there's a little incarnation, right? A little like a mini one. It's not not want to don't want to seem, uh, heretical or anything, but there's this little like mini thing that happens. And so that aspect has a has a lower part, which is the nexus of possibilities that coming together, possibilities and then this thing that this logos, which comes down So this nexus of possibilities, you could call it a mountain, a house, temple, a body that's Mary,</p><p id="RNgLUhxKS">Speaker 4: this means a radical transformation in your salience landscape, a radical transformation of right what it's like to be you. It's this deeply perspective and participatory transformation, and Jesus is saying he incarnates the principle by which you can intervene in your own personal history, or by which maybe you want to say intervention can occur in your own personal history, such that this meta Neue you will have a new mind, a new heart, a new model existence. You will be born again.</p></div><h3 id="sE0hXD9uX">Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-09">March 9th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><p id="82gGNA9wr">Speaker 4: this? Because loving someone can be expressed by being sad when they're absent, being happy when they're present, Being jealous when there's somebody else around being angry when they're neglecting you. Love isn't a feeling. It isn't an emotion. It is a modal way of being. It is an agent arena relationship and what Jesus seems to be incarnate ng as a Kairos. To change the history of the world and to offer you to change your own personal history is a different kind of love.</p><p id="oJcnFbBTx">Speaker 4: love the cookie because we can consume it. We love our friends because we are in reciprocity with them. What kind of love is this? And this is what Jesus claimed was how God loved individuals. This is the love that a parent has for a child. This is not the love of consummation. You're not trying to consume the child that's evil. And it's not friendship. You're not. When you bring a child home from the hospital, I've done this twice, right, that that's all. Your friend. It's not even a person you</p><p id="yp5vmpmEU">Speaker 4: I've done this twice, right, that that's all. Your friend. It's not even a person you can't like. It's basically a slug, but Here's the astonishing thing. You love it not because of any where you can consume it or be one with it. Yeah, you don't love it because, hey, what a great friendship. You love it and we write You love it, because by loving it, you turn a non person into a person. It's the</p><p id="xjyQwQfgP">Speaker 4: and we write You love it, because by loving it, you turn a non person into a person. It's the closest thing to a miracle, and that sounds hackney. I know, but stop and think about this. You depend on a GAAP AIDS because people loved you before you're a person that you have become the person you are love turns non person animals into moral agent persons. It's like like like somehow, if I could just care about right my sofa enough, it would turn into a Ferrari or something.</p><p id="XSL-EJOwY">Speaker 4: my sofa enough, it would turn into a Ferrari or something. It's that powerful. And here's what Jesus was offering that love is can be made. It can be exacted and made available for all. Here's what is on offer. Here's why Christianity will take the Roman Empire 

Speaker 0: culturally 

Speaker 4: with a gap. Christianity can say to all of the non persons of the Roman Empire. All the women, all the Children, all the non male citizens, all the sick, all the poor, all the widows can take all of those non persons and say We will turn you into persons,</p><p id="f0wm23S0T">Speaker 2: it wasn't. I mean, you know, these things grasping these things slips out in and out of my capacity. And I mean, you did a lovely job there of, of, of, of making a symbolic account for the virginity of Mary. I understand that I understand 

Speaker 1: well, but no one is going to prove the virginity of Mary. Historically, I mean that that's not that's something which is not. That, obviously is not possible. It's a secret. There's a secret aspect to virginity, which is actually part of its function, and it's also part of its How can I say this? It's part of its of its mystery right, which is something which is which is not public, you know, it's it belongs to the identity. 

Speaker 2: It belongs

But but the assumption is always that wisdom will make your life better. Or what do you mean by that? Well, you mean well, more. But more money is better than less. Money and finer clothes are better than poorer clothes, and better food is better than lesser close. And so and that in in biblical cadence is very real.

There's two or three other videos that came out now about Jordan in this video so suddenly, you know, I've got 2.5 years of nothing, and suddenly I've got a glut. And over the last 2.5 years I've been building all sorts of other projects, and I don't want to just go out the window while Jordan sort of rushes to the top of the of the salience hierarchy. But this entire when when you look at the woke questions and Christian nationalism and all of these things that are currently in the news, you have to understand the history of Protestantism and Christianity in America where you know, I had that conversation about the founding of New</p><p id="Dwa_r_9eZ">Speaker 0: years of nothing, and suddenly I've got a glut. And over the last 2.5 years I've been building all sorts of other projects, and I don't want to just go out the window while Jordan sort of rushes to the top of the of the salience hierarchy. But this entire when when you look at the woke questions and Christian nationalism and all of these things that are currently in the news, you have to understand the history of Protestantism and Christianity in America where you know, I had that conversation about the founding of New Haven, Connecticut, as the city of God, um, and and the Puritans did this. And so, you know, after the Civil</p><p id="A4CLpak4l">Speaker 0: of of this of this evangelical unity between the fundamentalist and the modernist. And this question that Jordan Jordan is asking right now is really at the center of it. 

Speaker 2: But this doctor and I don't understand 

Speaker 1: Do I think I think a way to to see it has to do with with attention again. And it has to do with a hierarchy of attention. If you try to build heaven, you're going to fail. You're gonna fail miserably because you because you're not aiming high enough, right, you're you're aiming, and then you you get stuck in this, 

Speaker 0: you cannot build it in the age of decay. This is</p><p id="LigrB5ySB">Speaker 2: or we end up with with the catastrophe, continual catastrophe of unintended consequences. But as you yourself said, we are aiming for something better. So the question is, how do you perso pursue utopia while avoiding the pitfalls? 

Speaker 0: I go back to x one after the crucifixion after the resurrection, right before the ascension acts one, the disciples say. Now will you restore the kingdom to Israel and Jesus says you will be You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you and you will be my witnesses. The job in this dispensation is to bear witness, 

Speaker 2: and that's a theological question.</p><p id="jeAqupsyP">Speaker 0: has to be. At the top of the hierarchy is the frame of frames is the system of systems. It's the only. It's the only thing at the top of the hierarchy that can in fact include the whole. Which is why if and this is about what Jonathan is about to say, 

Speaker 1: because they're they're a fragment of reality, they need to be encompassed together in order to reach something higher. And 

Speaker 2: so that's the danger of ideology. It's the part takes the place of the whole. 

Speaker 1: So the the The idea is that if you actually if you worship God, then those other things will. We'll kind of lay themselves out slowly and you won't be able to force them. They kind of lay themselves out slowly and they'll start to manifest, You know, progressively</p><p id="jBdOivY2k">Speaker 1: that she's doing. If you look at what she's doing, she's first of all. She bought something expensive. She's sacrificing it. She's she's sacrificing it to, to to bow down and to wash the feet, to submit, to sacrifice to and to worship. So those three things, like when I talk about the aim, how you end up having to submit to that name. And so this is what Christ is saying. First comes worship. Then the world lays itself out below that in a in an appropriate way. And those are the sermon on the Mount, says two, and those that are are saying help the poor as their ultimate goal in the inscription says that Judas didn't even want to help the poor. He wanted to take the money for himself, really like he was a thief, actually, and he was taking the money out of the purse and so</p><p id="wnI5I80wz">Speaker 0: on the poor, but what you do when you help the poor is that you actually, in Stan, she ate through dedication all this virginal stuff you just you in, Stan. She ate Christ. Who does what he gives out. It's this self donation. It's this a gap, and it's it's the if you if you treat the poor with a gap rather than just Oh, you like money. Here's money. But if you treat the poor with a gap, you you invoke this saving power that transforms and you avoid some of the things that happens in attempts to help the poor donor resentment. Um, all</p><p id="SAdg5FJG8">Speaker 1: absolute identification and tracing and all of these weird, these kind of weird gestures that show that they think they can control reality is, is, uh, it's leading us towards a very dangerous place. 

Speaker 2: Well, one of the things I noticed I did some work on a committee at one point that was advising the U. N in relationship to the establishment of its millennial goals. And there was hundreds of goals, never not rank ordered. And so it was a Tower of Babel because you can't have hundreds of goals that aren't rank ordered and have any goals at all, because the goal to have a goal means a hierarchy. Something has to be more important than something else.</p><p id="LSksHMw80">Speaker 2: much the pity for me. Mm. No. 

Speaker 0: No. Well, I'm going to pray. I never pray in my monologues, but I want to pray for Jordan. Pray for Jonathan. Yeah, Lord, you are the story maker, and a few of us have seen a story like Jordan's Lord. You know all things and we believe that history isn't random, but you were, in fact, as Sam Harris said, Yeah, as a tractor beam pulling us into the future. And so I ask Lord, that should be</p></div><h3 id="bQ25PN83G">Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-09">March 9th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><p id="wE-gS1ckD">Speaker 0: that you are not you are not ideas that he is trying to come to terms with that. That's a that's a That's a frame confusion. I ask Lord that you would continue to move through his life, which you clearly have been doing, and that you move in his heart and and that you give him some of what he's seeking, whether that be in sight or relief from his pain or rest for his soul. Bless his family that he so dearly loves. Be with Jonathan as well and continue to use Jonathan and bless him and watch over him. You hear my prayer In the name of Jesus. Amen.
