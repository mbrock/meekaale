It doesn‚Äôt cohere outwards, it‚Äôs not meant for others, it‚Äôs often secret and confidential. </p><p>My <a class="ref" href="/topics/story">Story</a> should be something that people could tell in broad strokes, maybe after my death, in an <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> and hopefully nice way. That wouldn‚Äôt be a <a class="ref" href="/topics/story">Story</a> of my confidential inner turmoils, etc‚Äîit would be about who I was, what I did, what I said. </p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/after-virtue">üìô After Virtue</a></h3><div><blockquote>Once we have understood its importance the claim that the concept of an action is secondary to that of an <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> action will perhaps appear less bizarre and so too will the claim that the notion of ‚Äòan‚Äô action, while of the highest practical importance, is always a potentially misleading abstraction.</blockquote><blockquote>The Aristotelian tradition has occupied two distinct places in my argument: first, because I have suggested that a great part of modern morality is <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> only as a set of fragmented survivals from that tradition, and indeed that the inability of modern moral philosophers to carry through their projects of analysis and justification is closely connected with the fact that the concepts with which they work are a combination of fragmented survivals and implausible modern inventions; but in addition to this the rejection of the Aristotelian tradition was a rejection of a quite distinctive kind of morality in which rules, so predominant in modern conceptions of morality, find their place in a larger scheme in which the virtues have the central place; hence the cogency of the Nietzschean rejection and refutation of modern moralities of rules, whether of a utilitarian or of a Kantian kind, did not necessarily extend to the earlier Aristotelian tradition.</blockquote><blockquote>Secreted within Marxism from the outset is a certain radical individualism. In the first chapter of Capital when Marx characterizes what it will be like ‚Äòwhen the practical relations of everyday life offer to man none but perfectly <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> and reasonable relations‚Äô what he pictures is ‚Äòa community of free individuals‚Äô who have all freely agreed to their common ownership of the means of production and to various norms of production and distribution. This free individual is described by Marx as a socialized Robinson Crusoe; but on what basis he enters into his free association with others Marx does not tell us. At this key point in Marxism there is a lacuna which no later Marxist has adequately supplied. It is unsurprising that abstract moral principle and utility have in fact been the principles of association which Marxists have appealed to, and that in their practice Marxists have exemplified precisely the kind of moral attitude which they condemn in others as ideological.</blockquote><blockquote>In the first chapter of Capital when Marx characterizes what it will be like ‚Äòwhen the practical relations of everyday life offer to man none but perfectly <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> and reasonable relations‚Äô what he pictures is ‚Äòa community of free individuals‚Äô who have all freely agreed to their common ownership of the means of production and to various norms of production and distribution.

Un<a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> actions are failed candidates for the status of <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> action; and to lump un<a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> actions and <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> actions together in a single class of actions and then to characterize action in terms of what items of both sets have in common is to make the mistake of ignoring this. It is also to neglect the central importance of the concept of <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligibility">Intelligibility</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>A central thesis of this book is that the breakdown of this project provided the historical background against which the predicaments of our own culture can become <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a>.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/being-in-the-world">üìô Being-In-The-World</a></h3><div><blockquote>Traditional <a class="ref" href="/topics/ontology">Ontology</a> has always sought to understand the everyday world by finding something on the level of the occurrent, such as substance, sense data, or representations in transcendental consciousness, that is supposed to be <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> without reference to anything else, and then sought to show how everything else can be seen to be <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> because it is built up out of these self-sufficient elements.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/learning-from-macintyre">üìô Learning From MacIntyre</a></h3><div><blockquote>In <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> so construed, we do not need an <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> plot with a beginning, middle and end: we do not all have to be Aristotelian tragic heroes. Rather, <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> for MacIntyre, is a <a class="ref" href="/topics/story">Story</a> of repetition and re-creation: of our repeated efforts to get clearer on, perhaps revise and shape, and try to achieve our final ends.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/philosophy-and-the-mirror-of-nature">üìô Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature</a></h3><div><blockquote>The ‚Äúlast‚Äù philosophy, could there be such a thing, would not be a philosophy, as we know it, at all: it would be, if it were <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a>, an odd kind of poem, or an odd kind of technical manual.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-spell-of-the-sensuous">üìô The Spell of the Sensuous</a></h3><div><blockquote>This new, seemingly autonomous, reflective awareness is called, by Socrates, the psyche, a term he thus twists from its earlier, Homeric significance as the invisible breath that animates the living body and that remains, as kind of wraith or ghost, after the body‚Äôs death. (The term psych√™ was derived from an older Greek term, psychein, which meant ‚Äúto breathe‚Äù or ‚Äúto blow‚Äù.) For Plato, as for Socrates, the psych√™ is now that aspect of oneself that is refined and strengthened by turning away from the ordinary sensory world in order to contemplate the <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> Ideas, the pure and eternal forms that, alone, truly exist.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
