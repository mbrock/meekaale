Let's make sense of experience and explore the perceptual control hierarchy. https://t.co/icT9Zs4j4V</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Living organisms control their perception through negative feedback control, in a continous loop in which perception (input) is compared to a reference signal (output from higher systems). The error (difference) continously drives output (acting on lower systems/the environment). https://t.co/NsRbmcqF1t</p><div class="indent"></div><p>This hierarchical architecture of nested control systems allows for controlling complex perceptions, building up from lowest level sensory input to highest level control of identity or worldview. https://t.co/YfmdYW4KVI</p><div class="indent"></div><p>PCT helps us understand how we reach our goals in many ways, continuously. How we regain control when we we miss our target or have conflicted goals. https://t.co/wxVkF8naAu</p><div class="indent"></div><p>William T. Powers hypothesized 11 levels of perceptual control, each level building on top of the levels below. https://t.co/hfcKYbPaMW</p><div class="indent"></div><p>For example: configuration control explains how we make sense of intensities (level 1) combined into sensations (level 2). Comparable to the idea of a Gestalt. https://t.co/KImH9sImoD</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Higher up the hierarchy, we control how we go along with the flow through sequence control. https://t.co/TcIvmI2RQ2</p><div class="indent"></div><p>...Or to control multiple sequences, we've got program control, making choices. https://t.co/X9temNV0Sw</p><div class="indent"></div><p>To direct our choices when options conflict, we use principle control, sensing intuitively what's important or meaningful. https://t.co/Q8BimZdzuX</p><div class="indent"></div><p>... and at the highest level our principles are united in system concepts, our worldview, our experience of what is true. https://t.co/x0GgEydGU8</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Through exploring these levels, many fragmented concepts of psychology make sense. Emotion emerges with gaining or losing control. The experience of time and self are limited to slices of the hierarchy. https://t.co/In2EJI6BXA</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Enjoy the exploration of the entire hierarchy (+the option of a 12th level) in my slideshow with audio and video comments.  https://t.co/eAODkdnnvU</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Explore the Perceptual Levels in the Dutch version of this presentation + many other Dutch articles about PCT and Method of Levels therapy at our website https://t.co/DV4CXTwJsS
