A kind of mental anarchy is probably the infantile ground state, with structures of governance emerging over time.

Can a man be his actual self with another man or woman? Before we can ask such an optimistic question as "What is a personal relationship?", we have to ask if a personal relationship is possible, or, are persons possible in our present situation?
