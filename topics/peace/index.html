The skin and the steel, the bluish tint of the vein. The spoon and the flame, that moment of bubbling alchemy that marked the entrance into another dimension. And when the needle penetrated her own body, the feeling of the drug itself. The taste of it from inside. The click of shackles released all over her nervous system, reaching back to smooth every jagged memory, and forward, a guarantee of the hours to come, a guardian against harsh thoughts and images, the settling in of a consciousness infused with <a class="ref" href="/topics/peace">Peace</a>. <a class="cite" href="/books/the-biology-of-desire#dJMPAqkCd" title="Go to quote">*</a></blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/crippled-grace">📙 Crippled Grace</a></h3><div><blockquote>Aquinas notes that sin causes us to be double minded, lacking internal integration, so that we are at war within ourselves (cf.

The forward trajectory of time, that is, will at last open outward, flowing back into the spacious eternity of living place (the “promised land”), and so into a golden age of <a class="ref" href="/topics/peace">Peace</a> between all nations.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
