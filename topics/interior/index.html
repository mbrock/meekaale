But this created thing contains within itself the process of its own creation, the system of production and reproduction by which it comes into being, sustains and perpetuates itself. It is civilization conceived in this way—not as a stable and completed object to be <a class="ref" href="/topics/external">External</a>ly assessed in its freestanding activity but as something that seems at once <a class="ref" href="/topics/interior">Interior</a> to that thing, the process residing within it that brings it about, and yet <a class="ref" href="/topics/exterior">Exterior</a> to the thing, the vast artifact in which all other artifacts (pitchers, plates, cities, and systems, all objects collectively designated “civilization”) are made and modified—that is Marx’s subject.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-spell-of-the-sensuous"> The Spell of the Sensuous</a></h3><div><blockquote>For the Navajo, then, the Air—particularly in its capacity to provide awareness, thought, and speech—has properties that European, alphabetic civilization has traditionally ascribed to an <a class="ref" href="/topics/interior">Interior</a>, individual human “<a class="ref" href="/topics/mind">Mind</a>” or “psyche.” Yet by attributing these powers to the Air, and by insisting that the “Winds within us” are thoroughly continuous with the Wind at large—with the invisible medium in which we are immersed—the Navajo elders suggest that that which we call the “<a class="ref" href="/topics/mind">Mind</a>” is not ours, is not a human possession. Rather, <a class="ref" href="/topics/mind">Mind</a> as Wind is a property of the encompassing world, in which humans—like all other beings—participate.</blockquote><blockquote>Within alphabetic civilization, virtually every human psyche construes itself as just such an individual “<a class="ref" href="/topics/interior">Interior</a>,” a private “<a class="ref" href="/topics/mind">Mind</a>” or “consciousness” unrelated to the other “<a class="ref" href="/topics/mind">Mind</a>s” that surround it, or to the environing earth. For there is no longer any common medium, no reciprocity, no respiration between the inside and the outside.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
