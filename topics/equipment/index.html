It is not disguised, but it is undiscovered. So, like the available, the world has to be revealed by a special tech- nique.12 Since we ineluctably dwell in the world, we can get at the world only by shifting our attention to it while at the same time staying involved in it.</blockquote><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a> by itself obviously cannot explain significance. Therefore, to account for the <a class="ref" href="/topics/equipment">Equipment</a>al whole in terms of occurrent elements, traditional <a class="ref" href="/topics/ontology">Ontology</a>, as developed by Descartes and still found in Husserlian phenomenology, information processing psychology, and Artificial Intelligence research, must supplement the bare things in <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a> that serve in the explanations provided by natural science, with function or value predicates.'</blockquote><blockquote>The world is what we directly understand and in terms of which one can see how <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>, <a class="ref" href="/topics/equipment">Equipment</a>, persons, etc. fit together and make sense. Thus worldliness and Dasein's correlative understanding of being are the proper themes for <a class="ref" href="/topics/ontology">Ontology</a>.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
