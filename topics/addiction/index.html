He, like many others, challenges the "brain disease model" of addiction, describing addiction instead as an especially potent and harmful instance of the same processes of desire-driven learning that is normally adaptive and integral to finding safety, happiness, and well-being.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/2021-03-06">March 6th, 2021</a></h3><div><p>Simler's article has this simple diagram of a brain topology, where we see an <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> as a nexus that's almost but not quite an independent living agent inside the <a class="ref" href="/topics/person">Person</a>.</p><p>Thinking about inner multiplicity like this, it seems natural to also think about the structures associated with <a class="ref" href="/topics/project">Project</a>s, interests, and vocations. I am a programmer but also a woodworker. These have their own languages, values, worldviews. They aren't just "roles" in a social sense. They are structurally similar to <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>s, gods, or selves.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/2021-03-07">March 7th, 2021</a></h3><div><p>The diverse elements that make up my life's particularity are "weird fishes" or "ghosts." They are clusters of agency and desire within me. My <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>s also give my life moral particularity; my daily need for caffeine is a real structure in my body.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/neurons-gone-wild">📰 Neurons Gone Wild</a></h3><div><blockquote>At the level above simple modules, but below the self, are poised what I will call sub-personal agents. These are systems like drives or instincts — hunger, lust, curiosity, greed, <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>s — that have agency recognizable even to lay-people. We don't need neuroscience to reason about these agents because we can 'feel' them, through introspection, pulling at our psyches — faintly or insistently, gently or violently. And indeed, people have been reasoning about these systems, as agents, for thousands of years.</blockquote><blockquote>Sub-personal agents also have immense explanatory power. This is most visible in the life of an addict. The addict 'himself' often doesn't want to keep up the <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>, but he keeps doing it anyway. Thus the addict is often described, even by himself, as powerless, and perhaps the best, most parsimonious explanation for his behavior is that there's literally another agent inside his brain — his inner addict — realized as a particular cabal of neurons and modules.</blockquote><blockquote>Obsessions, compulsions, <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>s, and other "inner demons" aren't the only agents with real power to control and explain our behavior; our brains are host to 'benevolent' agents as well. Our <a class="ref" href="/topics/conscience">Conscience</a>s, for example. These are agents that live inside our brains, who are being trained throughout our lives, but especially in childhood, by our interactions with parents, authority figures, and other moral teachers, and by various rewards and (especially) punishments.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/scattered-minds">📙 Scattered Minds</a></h3><div><blockquote>It may seem contradictory to acknowledge that in fact many people with ADD do act in selfish ways, particularly when it comes to their <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>s and compulsions of various sorts. How does that square with what has been said just now about the inhibiting effect of guilt and anxiety? I can attest that in some important aspects of my life—not all—I have always been a people pleaser, suppressing my truest self. I have also often behaved with narcissistic self-regard. The more the core self—the deepest impulses—is suppressed, the more compulsive are the attempts to compensate by satisfying superficial, infantile, instant-gratification impulses and desires.</blockquote><blockquote>My confusion—and I see this in the ADD addict repeatedly—was that both behavior dependencies represented genuine parts of me, though exaggerated. The <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> to music or books could masquerade in my own eyes as an aesthetic passion, and my <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> to work as a service to humanity—and I do have aesthetic passion, and I do wish to serve humanity.</blockquote><blockquote>All <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>s are anesthetics. They separate us from the distress in our consciousness. We throw off our familiar and tired consciousness to assume another mind state we find more comfortable, at least temporarily. Desperate to be out of our mind and unaware, we surrender to the <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>, to be lulled into a walking sleep.</blockquote><blockquote>The <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>, in a strange way, makes the addict feel more connected to life. The downside is that it separates him further and further from himself. He is feeding only his appetite, not his hunger.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-biology-of-desire">📙 The Biology of Desire</a></h3><div><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> results, rather, from the motivated repetition of the same thoughts and behaviours until they become habitual. Thus, <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> develops—it’s learned—but it’s learned more deeply and often more quickly than most other habits, due to a narrowing tunnel of attention and attraction.</blockquote><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> arises from the same feelings that bind lovers to each other and children to their parents. And it builds on the same cognitive mechanisms that get us to value short-term gains over long-term benefits.</blockquote><blockquote>Medical researchers are correct that the brain changes with <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>. But the way it changes has to do with learning and development—not disease.</blockquote><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> is a habit, which, like many other habits, gets entrenched through a decrease in self-control.</blockquote><blockquote>Thus, love and <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> are characterized by many of the same psychological and neural features. In fact, these authors use the phrase “partner <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>,” and that certainly seems accurate for many couples. Conversely, people who have struggled with substance <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> often describe their attraction to a particular substance as feeling like being in love.</blockquote><blockquote>People have referred to <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> as a habit throughout recent history. That’s just what it is. It’s a nasty, often relentless habit. A serious habit. An expensive habit. But what makes it so enduring, so relentless, so difficult to change? What makes it different from what we might call more benign habits? Three things. First, it’s a habit of thinking and feeling—a mental habit—not just a behavioural habit. It’s easier to stop singing in the shower than it is to stop seeing the world as violent or unfair. Second, the feeling part of <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> always includes the feeling of <a class="ref" href="/topics/desire">Desire</a>, which is of course the theme of this book. And third, it’s a habit that becomes compulsive—a topic that will be explored in detail later. Perhaps all habits, once formed, are compulsive to some degree. The brain is certainly built to make any action, repeated enough times, into a compulsion. But the emotional heart of <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>—in a word, <a class="ref" href="/topics/desire">Desire</a>—makes compulsion inevitable, because unslaked <a class="ref" href="/topics/desire">Desire</a> is the springboard to repetition, and repetition is the key to compulsion.</blockquote><blockquote>The accumbens is the front-runner of <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> because it is highly attuned to the perceived value of the goal. It is oriented to rewards; and drugs, sex, booze, and gambling are all about rewards.</blockquote><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>, like everything else we think and do, has a biological basis. And the final stages of <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>, when impulsivity gives way to compulsivity, result from synaptic patterns that reinforce themselves over countless repeated occasions—a creeping vine that eventually strangles the other flowers in the garden. Motivated repetition results in compulsion through biological changes in a brain that digs its own ruts. But that’s not a disease, and it’s not permanent.</blockquote><blockquote>So <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> is an aspect of personality development, often an extension of patterns formed by failed attempts to deal with negative emotions in childhood. In fact, addictive patterns aren’t just an outcome of personality development; they’re a continuation of that development. Addicts continue to grow and modify their self-image, generally for the worse, and so <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> becomes a part of the self, characterized by the imprint of earlier failures.</blockquote><blockquote>Now appeal is not just a devaluation of future goodies; in the case of <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>, it’s a gorge carved across the continuum of a person’s life, dividing personality development into an unexamined past and an unimagined future.</blockquote><blockquote>In <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>, the relentless preoccupation with immediate rewards carves a small burrow out of the potential richness of time.</blockquote><blockquote>The facility for viewing one’s life as a <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> may be what’s missing in <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>If the brain region that allows us to imagine the future is synched up with the brain regions that propel us toward our goals, and if that linkage is practiced and reinforced, so that synaptic highways become smooth and efficient, then <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> need be no more than a stage in the development of the self.</blockquote><blockquote>There are parts of the brain wrapped deeply within the cortical layers that we share with animals going all the way back to fish. These structures include a large and highly complicated crescent of tissue that sort of curls around the very centre of the brain. It’s called the striatum (shown in Figure 1) and it’s the main character—the villain—when it comes to <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>The accumbens is a dugout of ancient tissue, and it hums like an engine buried under the moving parts it controls—the other brain regions. The accumbens is the brain part you hear about most when it comes to <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>. It embodies the “hot” end of the striatum, the end with the most connections to other regions that give rise to emotions, expectancies, and actions.</blockquote><blockquote>In each <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> narrative, we can see an underlying current of anxiety, anger, or fear of rejection, and an unconscious collusion between the child and his or her caregivers to accept the burden of inadequacy. That collusion is exhausting. It creates a kind of emotional starvation.</blockquote><blockquote>OCD is often considered a pure form of the compulsive drive that marks the final stage of <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>. And we know that people with OCD arrange their lives into repetitive <a class="ref" href="/topics/ritual">Ritual</a>s. So it shouldn’t be surprising that most addicts find comfort, but also excitement, in the <a class="ref" href="/topics/ritual">Ritual</a>s that lead up to the act itself. The fastidious preparation of the heroin injection; the arrangement of a glass surface and a blade to pulverize crystals of cocaine; the dressing up that precedes a night of gambling or sexual excess. The <a class="ref" href="/topics/ritual">Ritual</a>s become gratifying in themselves, part of the webbing of symbolic significance.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-virtual-community">📙 The Virtual Community</a></h3><div><blockquote>Whenever people find something in a new communication medium so attractive that it becomes the focus of obsessive behavior, several questions arise: What is it about the way people are today, and the way we interact, that leaves so many people vulnerable to communication <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>?</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
