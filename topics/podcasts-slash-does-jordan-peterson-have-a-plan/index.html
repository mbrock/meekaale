If you really want to change your life, most people not, uh, there's always a few exceptions out there. Most people have to rearrange the habits of their lives because our lives are much more shaped by our habits than our aspirations.

Speaker 0: had the guts to tell Jordan that 

Speaker 1: or um he wouldn't listen to it. My sense is again when Jordan wants something, he goes for it single mindedly, and there's no question about his deep love for his wife or her deep love for him.
