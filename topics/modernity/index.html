The cultures we grow up in have tendencies towards <em>non-culture</em>. From <a class="ref" href="/books/reading-alasdair-macintyres-after-virtue">📙 Reading Alasdair MacIntyre’s After Virtue</a>:</p><blockquote>He finds the people of late <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> shifting toward a non-culture—a collection of competing individuals, who lack any shared conception of their goals as human beings. <a class="cite" href="/books/reading-alasdair-macintyres-after-virtue#qeZ5rqusz" title="Go to quote">*</a></blockquote><p>In <a class="ref" href="/books/all-things-shining">📙 All Things Shining</a>, this kind of structureless choice is part of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/phenomenology">Phenomenology</a> of <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/book-review-after-virtue">📰 Book Review: After Virtue</a></h3><div><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">Virtue Ethics</a>, as far as I can tell, just gives you a knowing look and says “The very fact that you interpret morality in terms of moral dilemmas is a symptom of the disease of liberal <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a>.” This is useful for sounding deeply wise, but little else.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/macintyre-on-money---prospect-magazine">📰 MacIntyre on Money - Prospect Magazine</a></h3><div><blockquote>The imposition of unjust debt is a symptom of the “moral condition of the economic system of advanced <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a>, and is in its most basic forms an expression of the vices of intemperateness, and injustice, and imprudence.”</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/a-rumor-of-angels">📙 A Rumor of Angels</a></h3><div><blockquote>The <a class="ref" href="/topics/catholic">Catholic</a> situation is different, at least in part because Catholicism has viewed the modern world with much more suspicion from the beginning and, as a result, has managed to keep up its cognitive defenses against <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> more effectively and until a much more recent date.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/after-virtue">📙 After Virtue</a></h3><div><blockquote>The social obstacles derive from the way in which <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> partitions each human life into a variety of segments, each with its own norms and modes of behavior.</blockquote><blockquote>The attractiveness of Nietzche’s position lay in its apparent honesty. When I was setting out the case in favor of an amended and restated emotivism, it appeared to be a consequence of accepting the truth of emotivism that an honest man would no longer want to go on using most, at least, of the language of past morality because of its misleading character. And <a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a> was the only major philosopher who had not flinched from this conclusion. Since moreover the language of modern morality is burdened with pseudo-concepts such as those of utility and of natural rights, it appeared that <a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>’s resoluteness alone would rescue us from entanglement by such concepts; but it is now clear that the price to be paid for this liberation is entanglement in another set of mistakes. The concept of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>an ‘great man’ is also a pseudo-concept, although not always perhaps—unhappily—what I earlier called a fiction. It represents individualism’s final attempt to escape from its own consequences. And the <a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>an stance turns out not to be a mode of escape from or an alternative to the conceptual scheme of liberal individualist <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a>, but rather one more representative moment in its internal unfolding. And we may therefore expect liberal individualist societies to breed ‘great men’ from time to time. Alas!</blockquote><blockquote>If I am right then, Stoicism is a response to one particular type of social and moral development, a type of development which strikingly anticipates some aspects of <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a>. Hence we should expect, and we do in fact find, recurrences of Stoicism.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/hyperobjects">📙 Hyperobjects</a></h3><div><blockquote>There we were, trolling along in the age of industry, capitalism, and technology, and all of a sudden we received information from aliens, information that even the most hardheaded could not ignore, because the form in which the information was delivered was precisely the instrumental and mathematical formulas of <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> itself.</blockquote><blockquote>Presentism also manifests in the injunction to stop thinking and do something, the paradoxical form taken by the contemporary beautiful soul, a defining, overarching subject position of <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> that has been with us since the late eighteenth century. All too often the siren song of the beautiful soul these days comes in the form of a call to act, now!</blockquote><blockquote>Indeed, the vague sludge is precisely the problem of pollution. Process relationism is simply the last philosophical reflex of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> that creates the sludge. We need a philosophy of sparkling unicities; quantized units that are irreducible to their parts or to some larger whole; sharp, specific units that are not dependent on an observer to make them real.</blockquote><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> is like the dinosaur, rendered extinct by some planet-scale cataclysm. Small, weak mammals crawled out from the wreckage.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/learning-from-macintyre">📙 Learning From MacIntyre</a></h3><div><blockquote>In conditions of <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a>, as MacIntyre diagnoses the situation, this Aristotelian set-up for ethical education is all but ruled out—except, perhaps, for a fortunate few. We are, from MacIntyre’s point of view, born into a culture that inducts us into false images and inevitably misshapes our souls to some extent.</blockquote><blockquote>As MacIntyre tells us, in conditions of <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> even the conception of rationality is disfigured.</blockquote><blockquote>What I want to propose is a psychoanalytical complement to MacIntyre’s teaching. I think it—or something like it—is needed; especially if we want to take seriously the psychic efficacy of ethical teaching in the context of <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a>’s conflicts.</blockquote><blockquote>The psychoanalytic conversation is a way of intervening in the badly habituated ways that the non-rational soul has been functioning. It is able to undo some of those habits and at the same time promote healthier forms of communication between non-rational and rational parts of the soul. Also, importantly, it does so through the efficacy of increasing self-conscious understanding. In this way, it promotes Aristotle’s project in the context of <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a>.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/marxism-ethics-and-politics">📙 Marxism, Ethics and Politics</a></h3><div><blockquote>It is in the complex and wide-ranging analysis and critique of liberal <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a>, its moral philosophy and its institutions that MacIntyre highlights why we need not only Marx , but Aristotle, to develop the kind of resistance to the contemporary order that Marxists strive for.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/reading-alasdair-macintyres-after-virtue">📙 Reading Alasdair MacIntyre’s After Virtue</a></h3><div><blockquote>MacIntyre finds late <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> to be populated by individuals who have learned to understand themselves not in terms of their social backgrounds, relationships, or commitments, but in isolation from all of these.</blockquote><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/macintyres-critique-of-modernity">MacIntyre’s Critique of Modernity</a> has two main points: The first is that <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> has lost its capacity to understand the real practical wisdom of its traditional morality, and has formulated an approach to moral thinking that is unintelligible, unjustifiable, and ultimately arbitrary. The second is that morality, formulated in this modern fashion, can be used, and has been used, as a tool for social manipulation</blockquote><blockquote>Where the classical tradition saw imperfect people seeking human excellence through moral development, <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> sees imperfect people who must obey the rules of morality—period (p. 55). The task of modern moral philosophy was to find a rational basis for the rules of morality without directing those rules to any purpose beyond “morality.”</blockquote><blockquote>Any movement from is to ought presupposes a “functional concept” which is defined “in terms of the purpose or function which . . . [it is] characteristically expected to serve” (p. 58). MacIntyre presents the examples of a watch and a farmer; the watch is good if it keeps time accurately and the farmer is good if he farms well. But the modern concept of the human <a class="ref" href="/topics/person">Person</a> is not a functional concept, because <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> abstracts the <a class="ref" href="/topics/person">Person</a> from all roles, relationships, and responsibilities (p.</blockquote><blockquote>He finds the people of late <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> shifting toward a non-culture—a collection of competing individuals, who lack any shared conception of their goals as human beings.</blockquote><blockquote>Without the “background concepts” of <a class="ref" href="/topics/teleology">Teleology</a> and the <a class="ref" href="/topics/common-good">Common Good</a> that make it intellectually coherent, the tradition of the virtues became an empty shell in the dominant culture of <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a>. Yet, the language of virtue has remained a central part of the Western moral vocabulary, and this has led to several redefinitions of virtue over the past few centuries.</blockquote><blockquote>Where the tradition had defined the virtues as habits of transformed desire that enable people to seek the <a class="ref" href="/topics/common-good">Common Good</a>, <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> sees the virtues either as good natural desires or as dispositions to serve the public good against one’s own desires.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
