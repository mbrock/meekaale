It was only by venturing out in public that even the master could enjoy a measure of freedom and agency. At <a class="ref" href="/topics/home">Home</a>, there was a defined role with duties for everyone. And if you never really left the domestic sphere, you were basically never really free.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/meaning-and-pointing">📰 Meaning and Pointing</a></h3><div><blockquote>If, as I have tried to motivate above, meaning is pointing, then in order to perform the essential human functions of experiencing meaning and feeling at <a class="ref" href="/topics/home">Home</a> in the world – in order not to get lost in derealization or depersonalization – we must navigate complexity using comfortable mental maps that point to our shared social world of information.</blockquote><blockquote>Mental maps for geographic navigation may help us feel at <a class="ref" href="/topics/home">Home</a>, creating a “meaningful” pointing relationship between what is in our minds and the world around us, but most of our time is spent not in geographic space, but in the information spaces created by language, technology, and culture. And we must have mental maps for these as well.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/being-in-the-world">📙 Being-In-The-World</a></h3><div><blockquote>Not only is human being interpretation all the way down, so that our practices can never be grounded in human nature, God's will, or the structure of rationality, but this condition is one of such radical rootlessness that everyone feels fundamentally unsettled (unheimlich), that is, senses that human beings can never be at <a class="ref" href="/topics/home">Home</a> in the world. This, according to Heidegger, is why we plunge into trying to make ourselves at home and secure.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/phenomenology-and-virtue-ethics">📙 Phenomenology and Virtue Ethics</a></h3><div><blockquote>Although qualitatively richer senses of the good arise through our active involvement with our <a class="ref" href="/topics/home">Home</a>-world, actually leaving our culturally saturated horizon of familiarity offers even more dramatic alterations in our appreciation of the good.</blockquote><blockquote>If alienation is fundamentally a mood of “not feeling at <a class="ref" href="/topics/home">Home</a>,” and if this mood is an integral part of the human drama, then developing an expertise is an important therapy for this ailment. By becoming skilled or conversant with a discipline, we commune or harmonize with a part of reality, which not only gives content to our sense of self but grants us access to a community of like-embodied subjects.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/play-anything">📙 Play Anything</a></h3><div><blockquote>My <a class="ref" href="/topics/home">Home</a> is a delightful <a class="ref" href="/topics/playground">Playground</a> not because it’s large, but because of the variety of things I am able to do with it.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-spell-of-the-sensuous">📙 The Spell of the Sensuous</a></h3><div><blockquote>The Jewish sense of exile was never merely a state of separation from a specific locale, from a particular ground; it was (and is) also a sense of separation from the very possibility of being placed, from the very possibility of being entirely at <a class="ref" href="/topics/home">Home</a>. This deeper sense of displacement, this sense of always already being in exile, is inseparable, I suggest, from alphabetic literacy, this great and difficult magic of which the Hebrews were the first real caretakers.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
