For <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> it is impossible for the disabled person to be truly happy. This prejudice cannot be brushed aside, since it indicates one of the problems of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a>, which is the tendency for virtue to be conceived of in ways that entrench the status quo.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/phenomenology-and-virtue-ethics">📙 Phenomenology and Virtue Ethics</a></h3><div><p><strong>Full Title</strong>: Phenomenology and <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a></p><blockquote>Although ethics, generally speaking, might benefit from phenomenological investigations, <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> is a tradition that is particularly well suited to the depth descriptions of phenomenology.</blockquote><blockquote>Most basically, <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> is concerned with our ability to become better than we are or to flourish. <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> depends, therefore, upon our appreciation of the flow of interpretive objectification, where our embodied relationship to things is the focal concern.</blockquote><blockquote>A trademark feature of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> is its focus on flourishing as the basis of an excellent life. I bring this focus into dialogue with phenomenology by showing how the natural attitude limits our well-being because of the way it takes reality as something given, ordinary, and stable. As a remedy to this problem, I discuss avenues of engagement that help foster in us more open, enthusiastic, and responsible dispositions, which, in turn, allow us to relate to things, others, and ourselves in more fulfilling ways.</blockquote><blockquote>My more modest aim is to extend the suggestions of Dreyfus and Taylor and argue that there is both a methodological proximity and, to a lesser extent, a substantive ethical proximity between phenomenology and <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> around the centrality of character to moral flourishing.</blockquote><blockquote>If there is an emphasis on the Lebenswelt that is the condition for particular forms of reasoning, including ethical reasoning, then we can again begin to see some methodological connections with elements of both <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> and communitarian political thought, which affirm our historical embeddedness and the deep context-dependence of moral and political judgments and forms of agency.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-second-person-perspective-in-aquinass-ethics">📙 The Second-Person Perspective in Aquinas’s Ethics</a></h3><div><blockquote>The recognition that Aquinas’s <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> is radically non-Aristotelian raises a sensitive cultural issue, given the accumulated investment in Aristotle throughout the long history of commentary on Aquinas.</blockquote><blockquote>The brief answer is that the Aristotelian interpretation of Aquinas’s <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> has been in retreat for many years now, principally because of the work of analytic philosophers studying the infused virtues and by new generations of theologians such as Servais Pinckaers and Michael Sherwin, who have re-examined neglected aspects of Aquinas’s claims about the virtues and their integration with gifts, beatitudes, and fruits. So although this study is novel in certain ways, insofar as it proposes a new understanding of Aquinas’s <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> inspired by recent research in social cognition, its non-Aristotelian interpretation of Aquinas’s account is consonant with pre-existing and converging trends in both analytic philosophy and Thomist theology.</blockquote><blockquote>For Aquinas, however, this other personal agent is the Holy Spirit, and his entire network of perfective attributes is ordered toward friendship with God. The obvious objection, therefore, is that his entire approach is of little or no value to an atheist, or to a theist who wishes to develop a <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> without dependence on God, or indeed to a theist who wants a <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> that relates to God in a non-Thomistic manner.</blockquote><blockquote>Indeed, like the epicycles added to save the appearances of the Aristotelian model of the solar system, I shall argue that the modifications required for the Aristotelian interpretation of Aquinas’s <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> lack any obvious connections to one another or to the kinds of experiences that Aristotle taught us to relate to the notion of virtue.</blockquote><blockquote>Together with the influence of Aristotle on <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> generally and his undoubted influence on Aquinas, it is then easy to see why the idea that Aquinas’s <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> is a modified form of Aristotelianism still exercises a powerful hold on the scholarly imagination. In recent decades, however, new research has strongly criticized even a quasi-Aristotelian interpretation of Aquinas’s <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>By contrast, in the case of Aquinas’s account of the infused virtues, gifts, beatitudes, and fruits, we lack a corresponding synthetic picture. No matter how many lists and connections are marshalled, these facts are ‘dry bones’ without a grasp of the living whole. What is needed to complement and animate these facts is a metaphoric understanding that embodies the facts about Aquinas’s <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> and places them in a living context.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
