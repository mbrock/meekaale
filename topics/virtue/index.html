To recognize this is of course also to recognize the existence of an additional <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>, one whose importance is perhaps most obvious when it is least present, the virtue of having an adequate sense of the traditions to which one belongs or which confront one.</blockquote><blockquote>It is in looking for a conception of the good which will enable us to order other goods, for a conception of the good which will enable us to extend our understanding of the purpose and content of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>s, for a conception of the good which will enable us to understand the place of integrity and constancy in life, that we initially define the kind of life which is a quest for the good.</blockquote><blockquote>The <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>s therefore are to be understood as those dispositions which will not only sustain practices and enable us to achieve the goods internal to practices, but which will also sustain us in the relevant kind of quest for the good, by enabling us to overcome the harms, dangers, temptations and distractions which we encounter, and which will furnish us with increasing self-knowledge and increasing knowledge of the good.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/crippled-grace">üìô Crippled Grace</a></h3><div><blockquote>If eudaimonia is understood as the flourishing life, <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> argues that it is virtuous activity that achieves it. A <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> is a characteristic or trait‚Äîa habit of character‚Äîthat enables a person to succeed in their undertakings and, more broadly, to flourish in life.</blockquote><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>s are taught and modeled by our parents and leaders, and we learn them both through instruction and practice; practicing a <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> enables it to become a habit, internalized as a part of our character.</blockquote><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> is both rational and pleasurable, bringing together our reason and our emotion. <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> facilitates our achievements but is also its own reward.</blockquote><blockquote>The best friendships are only possible between people of equal <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> and, according to <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>, equal advantage, and are characterized by the joy of living together. Such relationships enable people to achieve their own good by acting in the interest of the other.</blockquote><blockquote>And so we come to the crux of the matter. For <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> it is impossible for the disabled person to be truly happy. This prejudice cannot be brushed aside, since it indicates one of the problems of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">Virtue Ethics</a>, which is the tendency for <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> to be conceived of in ways that entrench the status quo.</blockquote><blockquote>The New Testament contains some striking contrasts with <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>‚Äôs analysis of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>. In particular, it praises virtues that <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> knows nothing about‚Äîfaith, hope, and <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a>‚Äîand counts as virtues qualities that <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> treats as vice, such as <a class="ref" href="/topics/humility">Humility</a>.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/improvisation">üìô Improvisation</a></h3><div><blockquote>Aristotle saw humans as political beings. He saw the city-state as the unit of corporate life. Human flourishing lay in the appropriate conduct of these corporate relationships. This is politics. Politics concerns the discovery of common goods that would not have been identifiable without the discussions between people who might otherwise think of themselves as strangers. Politics thus makes possible the art of resolving issues in ways that do not lead to violence. Nonetheless Aristotle regards violence as inevitable too, and the <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>s he commends are ones that are particularly suited to the soldier.</blockquote><blockquote>The sacred community is the touchstone of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>. That which builds it up and enables it to be faithful is good and right and true; that which attempts to bypass it or contrives to render it invisible or undermines it from within is dubious, misguided, or dangerous.</blockquote><blockquote>They are formed in the virtues required to negotiate an awesome role: they are prepared to be the center of the story. They stand out from the crowd; they form friendships only with others of similar stature. They are self-sufficient and resilient amid setbacks. The definitive icon of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> is the soldier, who is prepared to risk death for the sake of a higher good. The noblest death is death in battle, for battle offers the greatest danger, thus requiring the greatest courage.</blockquote><blockquote>Aquinas did not seek to inspire his readers to be heroes. The <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>s he commends are not those that enable his readers to make decisive interventions in the heat of battle or the height of controversy. The <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>s he proposes are those that enable Christians to follow Christ. They are not called to be heroes. They are called to be saints. The word ‚Äúhero‚Äù does not appear in the New Testament. The word ‚Äúsaint‚Äù occurs sixty-four times. What is the difference between a hero and a saint? Five differences present themselves.</blockquote><blockquote>Virtue ethics has become a shorthand term for all the writers in the field who have grown tired of the conventional emphasis on decision and the neglect of the character of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/person">Person</a> or ‚Äúagent‚Äù making the decision. The emphasis on <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> in Christian ethics has shifted attention from the deed to the doer. It is the agent who matters, more than the action: ethics is about forming the life of the agent more than it is about judging the appropriateness of the action.</blockquote><blockquote>Wells charts a path of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> ethics that begins with Aristotle and Aquinas and is more recently conveyed in the work of Hauerwas and Alasdair MacIntyre. In the tradition of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> ethics, moral discernment is not reasoning from some universal code of morality known innately by all rational agents in every time and place, nor is it speculating potential outcomes about what would benefit the majority of persons. Ethics is instead about forming particular habits to become a good person with a new nature. For Christians, ethics is theology; it‚Äôs about becoming like God rather than navigating a quandary or crisis at a particular moment. Ethics is about who we are all the time‚Äîwhich is to say, ethics is about our story.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/phenomenology-and-virtue-ethics">üìô Phenomenology and Virtue Ethics</a></h3><div><blockquote>We can also see that the phenomenological focus on the evaluative origin of the objective world (through the study of passive synthesis) is coordinated with a quest for the good life or virtue. Since any and all focal objects are taken up by people who care about revealing their significance to themselves and others, objective insight is made possible by the enthusiastic engagement with objects that are worthy of awe and respect. <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> has given us reality and virtue can keep us passionate about discovering more about reality.</blockquote><blockquote>As I will argue, the core of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>‚Äîof phronetic perception‚Äîis training oneself to have those emotional states which allow one to perceive the appropriate range of possible actions within situations.</blockquote><blockquote>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi‚Äôs work on ‚Äúoptimal experience‚Äù (flow experience) provides several clues to the structure of a phenomenology of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> that recognizes <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> as a kind of expertise.</blockquote><blockquote>Agency is not a given characteristic of the human being.

The Greek term ‚Äúaret√™,‚Äù which we translate as ‚Äú<a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>‚Äù meant ‚Äúexcellence‚Äù in strength and skill as well as character, and courage, defined as ‚Äúthe quality necessary to sustain a <a class="ref" href="/topics/household">Household</a> and a community‚Äù was a central form of excellence</blockquote><blockquote>Practices occupy only the first place in MacIntyre‚Äôs three-part definition of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>. The account of virtues in terms of (1) practices is incomplete until it is supplemented in chapter fifteen with additional definitions in terms of (2) the <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> order of a whole human life, and (3) moral traditions.</blockquote><blockquote>We do not need the <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>s to perform simple tasks. We do not need to be virtuous to change tires, cook meals, or even to run for public office. We do need the virtues to excel in practices. We need the virtues to maintain automobiles, to become chefs, or to govern communities wisely. These latter practices, unlike the former acts, have an inherent moral component to them.</blockquote><blockquote>The <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>s therefore are to be understood as those dispositions which will not only sustain practices and enable us to achieve the goods internal to practices, but which will also sustain us in the relevant kind of quest for the good, by enabling us to overcome the harms, dangers, temptations, and distractions which we encounter, and which will furnish us with increasing self-knowledge and increasing knowledge of the good. (p. 219)</blockquote><blockquote>MacIntyre moves toward the third-level definition of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> when he begins to consider the ‚Äúmoral starting point‚Äù for human agents. MacIntyre holds that the life of one‚Äôs community, its historic debts toward others along with its responsibilities, and the debts owed to it, make up an ineliminable part of the setting for human agency.</blockquote><blockquote>MacIntyre‚Äôs notion of excellence in the agent as a bearer of tradition requires a specific <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>: ‚Äúthe <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> of having an adequate sense of the traditions to which one belongs or which confront one‚Äù (p. 223). On MacIntyre‚Äôs account, recognition and appreciation of one‚Äôs own culturally developed moral and intellectual peculiarities, and awareness and appreciation of those of others, is to be accounted a high <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>Late medieval moral theologians rejected natural <a class="ref" href="/topics/teleology">Teleology</a> as a basis for morality, and replaced it with divine command ethics. This entailed identifying moral <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> with obedience to divine commands.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-book-of-disquiet">üìô The Book of Disquiet</a></h3><div><blockquote>If I have no other <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>, I at least have the permanent novelty of free, uninhibited sensation.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-second-person-perspective-in-aquinass-ethics">üìô The Second-Person Perspective in Aquinas‚Äôs Ethics</a></h3><div><blockquote>I propose that the key to a new appreciation of Aquinas‚Äôs work is to be found in a set of dispositions that he appends to the <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>s, namely the ‚Äògifts.‚Äô Although the presence of the gifts in his accounts is no mystery, I use new research to re-interpret their pivotal role. In particular, I argue that Aquinas‚Äôs descriptions of the operation of these gifts have remarkable similarities to contemporary work in social cognition, especially the phenomenon of the joint attention of two persons, which has been described as a ‚Äòmeeting of <a class="ref" href="/topics/mind">Mind</a>s‚Äô and ‚Äòsharing an awareness of the sharing of focus.‚Äô</blockquote><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> is the super-virtue or transcendent <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> of Aquinas‚Äôs entire network of perfective attributes.</blockquote><blockquote>Aquinas claims that <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> is included in the definition of every <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>, not as being essentially every virtue, but because every virtue depends on it.</blockquote><blockquote>Just as everyday joint attention, in which two persons share an awareness of the sharing of focus, helps provide an understanding of how Aquinas thinks that the <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>s develop in relation to God, his work may also highlight the effects of everyday joint attention on the development of virtues in relation to others.</blockquote><blockquote>To give another example, while Aristotle adds that it is important to have the <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>s from youth, he neglects to examine in any detail how such <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>s are first acquired in youth, prior to a person acquiring the judgment of reason. Even within its own framework, Aristotle‚Äôs account leaves certain questions unanswered.</blockquote><blockquote>A preliminary indication that Aquinas adopts a radically non-Aristotelian approach to virtue ethics is the way in which he introduces the category of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>. It should occasion some wonder that, despite having the greatest respect for Aristotle and a detailed knowledge of the structure of the Nicomachean Ethics, Aquinas chooses not to use Aristotle‚Äôs definition of a virtue to introduce the category of virtue.</blockquote><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> is a good quality of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/mind">Mind</a>, by which we live righteously, of which no one can make bad use, which God works in us, without us.</blockquote><blockquote>In conclusion, the fact that Aquinas‚Äôs account of human flourishing is inherently theological does not limit its scope to theological matters. The role assigned to God in Aquinas‚Äôs account of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>s is plausibly played, to some extent, by other second-personal agents in everyday situations, such as parents interacting with their children.</blockquote><blockquote>Nevertheless, I could find no trace of any understanding of this interaction in the works of Aristotle, who wrote comparatively little about children and sometimes classified them with animals, to be guided by the reins of pleasure and pain. I began to wonder if the Aristotelian tradition was the last word on the <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>s, and whether a relationship of extraordinary importance had been hidden from the learned and wise and revealed by mere children.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
