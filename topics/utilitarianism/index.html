Her primary charge in the article is that, as secular approaches to moral theory, they are without foundation. They use concepts such as ‘morally ought,’ ‘morally obligated,’ ‘morally right,’ and so forth that are legalistic and require a legislator as the source of moral authority. In the past God occupied that role, but systems that dispense with God as part of the theory are lacking the proper foundation for meaningful employment of those concepts.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/macintyre-on-money---prospect-magazine">📰 MacIntyre on Money - Prospect Magazine</a></h3><div><blockquote>In philosophy he attacks consequentialism, the view that what matters about an action is its consequences, which is usually coupled with <a class="ref" href="/topics/utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a>’s “greatest happiness” principle. He also rejects Kantianism—the identification of universal ethical maxims based on reason and applied to circumstances top down.</blockquote><blockquote>MacIntyre seeks to oppose <a class="ref" href="/topics/utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a> on the grounds that people are called on by their very nature to be good, not merely to perform acts that can be interpreted as good.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/after-virtue">📙 After Virtue</a></h3><div><blockquote>I take it then that both the <a class="ref" href="/topics/utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a> of the middle and late nineteenth century and the analytical moral philosophy of the middle and late twentieth century are alike unsuccessful attempts to rescue the autonomous moral agent from the predicament in which the failure of the Enlightenment project of providing him with a secular, rational justification for his moral allegiances had left him.</blockquote><blockquote>Each moral agent now spoke unconstrained by the externalities of divine law, natural <a class="ref" href="/topics/teleology">Teleology</a> or hierarchical authority; but why should anyone else now listen to him? It was and is to this question that both <a class="ref" href="/topics/utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a> and analytical moral philosophy must be understood as attempting to give cogent answers; and if my argument is correct, it is precisely this question which both fail to answer cogently.</blockquote><blockquote>the claim of Marxism to a morally distinctive standpoint is undermined by Marxism’s own moral history. In all those crises in which Marxists have had to take explicit moral stances—that over Bernstein’s revisionism in German social democracy at the turn of the century or that over Khruschev’s repudiation of Stalin and the Hungarian revolt in 1956, for example—Marxists have always fallen back into relatively straightforward versions of Kantianism or <a class="ref" href="/topics/utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a>. Nor is this surprising. Secreted within Marxism from the outset is a certain radical individualism.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/philosophy-and-social-hope">📙 Philosophy and Social Hope</a></h3><div><blockquote>In a sense, the critics of <a class="ref" href="/topics/utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a> and pragmatism are right in saying that these doctrines animalize human beings. For both drop the idea of the extra added ingredient. They substitute the idea that human beings have, thanks to having invented language, a much larger behavioural repertoire than the beasts, and thus much more diverse and interesting ways of finding joy.</blockquote><blockquote>I think these are three plausible reasons for believing that neither democratic freedom nor philosophical pluralism will survive the next century. If I were a wagering Olympian, I might well bet my fellow divinities that pragmatism, <a class="ref" href="/topics/utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a> and liberalism would, among mortals, be only faint memories in a hundred years’ time.</blockquote><blockquote>Many of my fellow philosophers use the term ‘postmodernist relativism’ as if it were a pleonasm, and as if utilitarians, pragmatists and philosophical pluralists generally had committed a sort of ‘treason of the clerks’, as Julien Benda puts it. They often suggest that if philosophers had united behind the good old theologicometaphysical verities – or if James and Nietzsche had been strangled in their cradles – the fate of mankind might have been different. Just as Christian fundamentalists tell us that tolerance of homosexuality leads to the collapse of civilization, so those who would have us return to Plato and Kant believe that <a class="ref" href="/topics/utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a> and pragmatism may weaken our intellectual and moral fibre.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
