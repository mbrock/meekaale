He is not essentially, but becomes through his history, a teller of stories that aspire to truth. But the key question for men is not about their own authorship; I can only answer the question â€˜What am I to do?â€™ if I can answer the prior question â€˜Of what story or stories do I find myself a part?â€™ We enter human society, that is, with one or more imputed charactersâ€”roles into which we have been draftedâ€”and we have to learn what they are in order to be able to understand how others respond to us and how our responses to them are apt to be construed.
