Unlike the other children, they could not see their lives as <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a>s, as stories.

They had nothing but the present, nothing to look forward to, so many of them took their own lives.</blockquote><blockquote>Where the youths had stories to tell, continuity was already built into their sense of self by the structure of their society. Tribal councils remained active and effective organs of government. Elders were respected, and they took on the responsibility of teaching children who they were and where they had come from.

Carl Hart (also introduced in Chapter One) showed how members of minority groups living in the inner city chose to take drugs because other choices seemed unavailable or meaningless. Clearly these populations have something in common with Chandler’s high-suicide communities—the loss of a viable cultural <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> in which their individual <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a>s made sense.</blockquote><blockquote>It seems that the creation of this larger <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> is intended to build a sense of continuity that works as scaffolding for individual <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a>s, and that’s what made the difference in suicide rates among Native youth.</blockquote><blockquote>The facility for viewing one’s life as a <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> may be what’s missing in <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>Stories don’t work without emotional themes. They would be impossible to follow. There would be no impetus to get to the next paragraph or the next chapter, either for the main character or for the reader.

So the beatitudes might be classified as belonging properly to the genre of <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> only retrospectively, once the end has been attained. Prior to this completion, the beatitudes share something of the characteristics of a promise, since the second clause of each beatitude is a future contingent proposition that is true to the extent to which its speaker is reliable.</blockquote><blockquote>This central role of second-person relatedness in a child’s development appears to provide a useful metaphor for understanding at least part of what Aquinas means by the beatitudes.
