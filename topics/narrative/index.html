Rather, <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> for MacIntyre, is a <a class="ref" href="/topics/story">Story</a> of repetition and re-creation: of our repeated efforts to get clearer on, perhaps revise and shape, and try to achieve our final ends.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/reading-alasdair-macintyres-after-virtue">ðŸ“™ Reading Alasdair MacIntyreâ€™s After Virtue</a></h3><div><blockquote>Practices occupy only the first place in MacIntyreâ€™s three-part definition of virtue.

A subtlety, however, is that this progression refers to a future completion. So the beatitudes might be classified as belonging properly to the genre of <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> only retrospectively, once the end has been attained. Prior to this completion, the beatitudes share something of the characteristics of a promise, since the second clause of each beatitude is a future contingent proposition that is true to the extent to which its speaker is reliable.</blockquote><blockquote>This central role of second-person relatedness in a childâ€™s development appears to provide a useful metaphor for understanding at least part of what Aquinas means by the beatitudes. They are <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a>s made possible uniquely by second-personal relatedness, oriented toward goals that a person might not anticipate attaining or even be able to imagine in advance.</blockquote><blockquote>As promissory <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a>s, I suggest therefore that the contribution of the beatitudes in the VGBF network is to encourage the virtue of hope in such a way as to lead to the maturing of love.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
