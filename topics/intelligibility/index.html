Pursuit of these helps to give narrative structure and <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligibility">Intelligibility</a> to our lives, but these goods must be defended against their corruption by ‘institutions’, which pursue such 'external goods' as money, power and status.”</blockquote><blockquote>My own conclusion is very clear. It is that on the one hand we still, in spite of the efforts of three centuries of moral philosophy and one of sociology, lack any coherent rationally defensible statement of a liberal individualist point of view; and that, on the other hand, the Aristotelian tradition can be restated in a way that restores <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligibility">Intelligibility</a> and rationality to our moral and social attitudes and commitments.</blockquote><blockquote>But to this I want to reply that the concept of an <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> action is a more fundamental concept than that of an action as such. Un<a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> actions are failed candidates for the status of <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> action; and to lump un<a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> actions and <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> actions together in a single class of actions and then to characterize action in terms of what items of both sets have in common is to make the mistake of ignoring this. It is also to neglect the central importance of the concept of <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligibility">Intelligibility</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>The importance of the concept of <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligibility">Intelligibility</a> is closely related to the fact that the most basic distinction of all embedded in our discourse and our practice in this area is that between human beings and other beings.
