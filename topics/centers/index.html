These coherent entities all have, in varying degree, some quality of ‚Äú<a class="ref" href="/topics/life">Life</a>.‚Äù</p><p>For any given center, this quality of life comes about as a result of cooperation between the other living <a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a> at several scales, which surround it, which contain it, and which appear within it. </p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/thread-on-visual-attention-and-semantic-centers">Thread on Visual Attention and Semantic Centers</a></h3><div><p>but I'm interested in this also because I wonder if <a class="ref" href="/topics/christopher-alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>'s proto-scientific theory of <a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a> has been brought to empiricism in studies of visual attention </p><p>and there is also a question for me about how to see Alexander's <a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a> as both visual and semantic

he presents his "theory" sometimes in a mode of almost pure geometry

but clearly he is attuned to how <a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a> are never purely geometric but always enmeshed in meaningness </p><p>so I imagine an eye-tracking study of a visually complex scene with lots of contrasting items and geometric <a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a>

and somewhat off-center, in the midst of everything, is a pregnant woman gently holding her hands around her exposed belly </p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/thread-on-at-kev-mcg-s-the-game-of-quality">Thread on @kev_mcg's The Game of Quality</a></h3><div><p>also love this emphasis on mysteries, like allowing life to revolve around questions without needing them to be answered finally or straightforwardly, they can still be <a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a> of inquiry and activity https://t.co/inpFGO5pHB </p><p>so that clarifies a little confusion I have about goal-crafting

the <a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a> of my life are open-ended and irresolvable

I can't always make goals as if my life is "already adequately characterized"

my striving has to include the need for self-amendment and discovery </p><p>and here is @kev_mcg making it clear how <a class="ref" href="/topics/christopher-alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>'s style of enhancing the <a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a> in the environment inspired by <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>s is a way of reenchanting the world in a direct, material, pushing-atoms-around kind of way https://t.co/iA5oq5mcwX </p><p>and a good reminder that creating <a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a> of life doesn't always depend on architecture or moving things, it's also a matter of perceiving and enacting on a more personal level https://t.co/5J9dkgOa8t </p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/deep-laziness">üì∞ Deep Laziness</a></h3><div><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a> are the basic building blocks of beauty, except that they‚Äôre rarely shaped like blocks. If you look at any beautiful thing, a building or a tree or a hand tool, it will possess strong <a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a>. </blockquote><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a> are ‚Äúthings‚Äù ‚Äì shapes, plants, doorways, furniture, faces, eyes, motifs, bounded spaces, boundaries, clouds. The <a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a> form the seeds for the next structure-preserving transformation. </blockquote><blockquote>In the context of behaviors, ‚Äú<a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a>‚Äù might be activities, virtues, places, people, ambiances, longings, imaginings, memories, times of day, flavors. A well-developed center will be easy to see; it will produce positive emotion, a feeling of quiet ease, of non-separateness from the world. It will carry many layers of elaboration and generation. It may be completely worked into the fabric of life, touching and intertwining with other <a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a>. </blockquote><blockquote>Behavioral ‚Äú<a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a>‚Äù are the things that feel most like reflections of your own self, that seem to connect effortlessly to the underlying wholeness in your life. The most important ones tend to have old roots. </blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-nature-of-order">üìô The Nature of Order</a></h3><div><blockquote>The observations I have used to build a modified picture of space and matter are observations which are available to anyone. They are not, in themselves, very astonishing. Many of them were well known to traditional artisans and artists. But, precisely because the observational method of Descartes forbade us from seeing these observables, they have dropped out of awareness. It might be said (by an adherent of mechanistic thinking) that they must not be true, cannot be true, because if they were, something would be wrong with the machinelike representation of the universe. I, on the other hand, started with a different kind of observation. I knew, intuitively, that observation of the inner feeling in a work of building, and the fact that different works of art have more feeling or less feeling, is a real thing. I based my whole method of analysis on the observations that I got by following this method, and on the observables which this method exposes to view.

And since, within this method, there is no arbitrary prohibition against discovering a nonmechanical <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a> in the structure of space, I was able to consider and discover such a <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>.

Thus the characteristics of the field of <a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a> which make it potentially profoundwhich make it the basis of great art and building - were available to my inspection, only because I used a method of observation that allowed me to check the feeling of a work as an objective matter. </blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
