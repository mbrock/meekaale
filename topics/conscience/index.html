Nor does he want weak Christians, Christians who have no will of their own, ‚Äúremote-controlled‚Äù Christians incapable of creativity, who always seek to connect with the will of someone else and are not free. Jesus wants us free. And where is this freedom created? It is created in dialogue with God in the <a class="ref" href="/topics/person">Person</a>‚Äôs own <a class="ref" href="/topics/conscience">Conscience</a>. If a Christian is unable to speak with God, if he cannot hear God in his own <a class="ref" href="/topics/conscience">Conscience</a>, he is not free, he is not free.</blockquote><blockquote>The <a class="ref" href="/topics/conscience">Conscience</a> is the interior place for listening to the truth, to goodness, for listening to God; it is the inner place of my relationship with him, the One who speaks to my heart and helps me to discern, to understand the way I must take and, once the decision is made, to go forward, to stay faithful.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/george-herbert-mead-and-the-unity-of-the-self">üì∞ George Herbert Mead and the Unity of the Self</a></h3><div><blockquote>This principle of agreement with oneself is very old; it was actually discovered by Socrates, whose central tenet, as formulated by Plato, is contained in the sentence: ‚ÄúSince I am one, it is better for me to disagree with the whole world than to be in disagreement with myself.‚Äù From this sentence both Occidental ethics, with its stress upon being in agreement with one‚Äôs own <a class="ref" href="/topics/conscience">Conscience</a>, and Occidental logic, with its emphasis upon the axiom of contradiction, took their starting point.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/neurons-gone-wild">üì∞ Neurons Gone Wild</a></h3><div><blockquote>Obsessions, compulsions, addictions, and other "inner demons" aren't the only agents with real power to control and explain our behavior; our brains are host to 'benevolent' agents as well. Our <a class="ref" href="/topics/conscience">Conscience</a>s, for example. These are agents that live inside our brains, who are being trained throughout our lives, but especially in childhood, by our interactions with parents, authority figures, and other moral teachers, and by various rewards and (especially) punishments.</blockquote><blockquote>It's an interesting feature of our brains that society (or perhaps "elite society") can install these types of agents ‚Äî God, the <a class="ref" href="/topics/conscience">Conscience</a>, a sense of morality ‚Äî to look after its own interests. This is reminiscent of the way the UN will install weapons inspectors or election observers inside otherwise-sovereign nations.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/the-medium-is-the-messiah-mcluhans-religion-and-its-relationship-to-his-media-theory-|-read-mercer-schuchardt">üì∞ The Medium Is the Messiah: McLuhan's Religion and Its Relationship to His Media Theory | Read Mercer Schuchardt</a></h3><div><blockquote>Now we believe that each of us is endowed with an individual soul since conception, and the concomitant, an individual <a class="ref" href="/topics/conscience">Conscience</a>. The private individual with a private self is also charged with private responsibility for his or her own actions and quests for private salvation. The alphabet literally paved the way for these matters. These are New Testament times. The Old Testament, for example, had declared the Jews a chosen people: group salvation.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/beyond-order">üìô Beyond Order</a></h3><div><blockquote>Confront the possibility that manifests in front of you every second of your life with the desire to make things better, regardless of the burden you bear, regardless of life‚Äôs often apparently arbitrary unfairness and cruelty. All other approaches merely deepen the pit, increase its heat, and doom those who inhabit it to continual worsening of their already serious problems. Everyone knows it. Everyone‚Äôs <a class="ref" href="/topics/conscience">Conscience</a> proclaims it. Everyone‚Äôs true friend or loved one observes it and despairs when they see someone for whom they care failing to do what needs to be done.</blockquote><blockquote>If you attend to your <a class="ref" href="/topics/conscience">Conscience</a>, you will begin to determine that some of the things you are doing are wrong. More precisely: if you are alerted to the possibility of your own wrongdoing by your <a class="ref" href="/topics/conscience">Conscience</a>, and you then begin to engage in a true dialogue with that same agent, you will begin to develop a clear picture of what is wrong‚Äîand, by implication, of what is right.</blockquote><blockquote>And then you determine to start acting in accordance with your <a class="ref" href="/topics/conscience">Conscience</a>. You decide that it is a partner, despite its adversarial form. You put all that you have discovered to be right into action, and you begin your ascent. You start to monitor yourself, ever more careful to ensure you are doing the right thing‚Äîlistening to what you say, watching yourself act, trying not to deviate from the straight and narrow path. That becomes your goal.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/phenomenology-and-virtue-ethics">üìô Phenomenology and Virtue Ethics</a></h3><div><blockquote>This is an agent, that is, who experiences the world as calling on her creativity to realize ‚Äúwhat is called for,‚Äù where the world itself does not provide an easy answer to what that is. This agent is an agent of co<a class="ref" href="/topics/conscience">Conscience</a>who realizes that she is responsible to the world, that her creativity is required in determining what that responsibility involves, and who has the strength of will to stand behind that recognition. In short, it is the virtues of agency that allow us to receive the call of the good.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
