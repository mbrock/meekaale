We're not exactly ancient <a class="ref" href="/topics/athens">Athens</a>, but we are a kind of republic of letters on the internet, bootstrapping new circuits of virtuous freedom within a decaying old order.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/crippled-grace"> Crippled Grace</a></h3><div><blockquote>Since this book claims to be a work of Christian theology, it is perhaps necessary to justify my reliance on Greek sources. It is still common for Protestant and Evangelical theologians to lament the supposed Hellenization of Christianity, but the appeal to Jerusalem over <a class="ref" href="/topics/athens">Athens</a> tends to be both anti-intellectual and totalizing, presuming that the Hebrew way of thinking is the high point of the history of ideas and that everything that follows the biblical canon is corruption and decline.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/prayer"> Prayer</a></h3><div><blockquote>Every day my vision clouds over so that I perceive nothing but a world of matter.
