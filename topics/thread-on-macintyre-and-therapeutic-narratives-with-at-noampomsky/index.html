MacIntyre’s narratives are strands in a texture of human social life, tradition, and shared morality. https://t.co/pLznhxfrWR </p><p id="B3kGLlucQ">A narrative is an agent’s <a class="ref" href="/topics/story">Story</a> considered as <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> in terms of roles, communities, values, etc. This type of therapeutic narrative is more like an inner <a class="ref" href="/topics/story">Story</a>. It doesn’t cohere outwards, it’s not meant for others, it’s often secret and confidential. </p><p id="M-k5txHZE">My <a class="ref" href="/topics/story">Story</a> should be something that people could tell in broad strokes, maybe after my death, in an <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> and hopefully nice way. That wouldn’t be a <a class="ref" href="/topics/story">Story</a> of my confidential inner turmoils, etc—it would be about who I was, what I did, what I said. </p><p id="auPAA-_8g">I suppose therapy at its best helps people deal with the issues that keep them from acting, that make them unintelligible to others, that lock them into self-preoccupation, depressive or anxious rumination, etc, so helping them to participate in non-therapeutic stories. </p><p id="qpBD7qqkL">But it also seems to me, as a patient of talk therapy, that there is indeed something insular and detached about it. It feels like the only guiding light is my own feelings, like it’s ungrounded in a peculiar way that reminds me of MacIntyre’s view of “emotivism.” </p><p id="bXDirwHwN">I am the therapist’s customer. My feelings are the arbiter of effectiveness. MacIntyre (citing Rieff’s “Triumph of the Therapeutic”) describes the therapeutic mode as one in which “truth has been displaced as a value and replaced by psychological effectiveness.” </p></div></section></article></html>
