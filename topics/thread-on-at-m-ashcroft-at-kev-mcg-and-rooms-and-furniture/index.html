my office tends to shape my awareness in one direction, namely into the computer </p><p id="ssbc2qPzq">the room is narrowish and the computer is parallel to the short side, so the screen is like “light at the end of a tunnel” or like the windscreen of a car </p><p id="aNmbSaiZY">I was thinking this office is like the “tower” of a “seer” with the computer as a synoptic gaze window or a crystal ball 🔮 for overviewing life, hovering over the world with thought... but I now think this is kinda iffy </p><p id="nyqBDixDC">so I now think it would be healthy to widen the space by strengthening other centers in the room
