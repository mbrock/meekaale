my office tends to shape my awareness in one direction, namely into the computer </p><p>the room is narrowish and the computer is parallel to the short side, so the screen is like “light at the end of a tunnel” or like the windscreen of a car </p><p>I was thinking this office is like the “tower” of a “seer” with the computer as a synoptic gaze window or a crystal ball 🔮 for overviewing life, hovering over the world with thought... but I now think this is kinda iffy </p><p>so I now think it would be healthy to widen the space by strengthening other centers in the room

an inspiration here is like a boat’s cabin that sails in the open sea but maintains a convivial interiority that doesn’t only face out to the water </p><p>so the seafarers would do their sailing navigating work and then go back to the <a class="ref" href="/topics/interior">Interior</a> and like play some cards around a table; there’s a cozy sense of place inside, that balances the vastness of the sea </p><p>there’s also a McLuhan thing where the computer’s medium is the message: regardless of the screen’s content, it has a fundamental shaping effect on my body, my senses, and my awareness of space </p></div></section></article></html>
