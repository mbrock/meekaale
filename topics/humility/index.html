In particular, it praises virtues that <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> knows nothing aboutâ€”faith, hope, and <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a>â€”and counts as virtues qualities that <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> treats as vice, such as <a class="ref" href="/topics/humility">Humility</a>.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/prayer">ðŸ“™ Prayer</a></h3><div><blockquote>Why value <a class="ref" href="/topics/humility">Humility</a> in our approach to God?

While the phraseology seems strange, a good many of these characteristics can be understood in terms of confident second-person dependence, and are hence compatible with <a class="ref" href="/topics/humility">Humility</a>, rather than a self-sufficient arrogance.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
