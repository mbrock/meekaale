The <a class="ref" href="/topics/household">Household</a> may have its own history stretching back through hundreds of years, as do the histories of some European farms, where the farm has had a life of its own, even though different families have in different periods inhabited it; and the marriage will certainly have its own history, a history which itself presupposes that a particular point has been reached in the history of the institution of marriage.</blockquote><blockquote>The catalogue of the virtues will therefore include the virtues required to sustain the kind of <a class="ref" href="/topics/household">Household</a>s and the kind of political communities in which men and women can seek for the good together and the virtues necessary for philosophical enquiry about the character of the good.</blockquote><blockquote>I confront the world as a member of this <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a>, this <a class="ref" href="/topics/household">Household</a>, this clan, this tribe, this city, this nation, this kingdom. There is no ‘I’ apart from these. To this it may be replied: what about my immortal soul? Surely in the eyes of God I am an individual, prior to and apart from my roles. This rejoinder embodies a misconception, which in part arises from a confusion between the Platonic notion of the soul and that of Catholic Christianity. For the Platonist, as later for the Cartesian, the soul, preceding all bodily and social existence, must indeed possess an identity prior to all social roles; but for the Catholic Christian, as earlier for the Aristotelian, the body and the soul are not two linked substances. I am my body and my body is social, born to those parents in this community with a specific social identity. What does make a difference for the Catholic Christian is that I, whatever earthly community I may belong to, am also held to be a member of a heavenly, eternal community in which I also have a role, a community represented on earth by the church.</blockquote><blockquote>Her heroines seek the good through seeking their own good in marriage.

When and why? How will the children be educated and disciplined, and by whom? Who does the cleaning? Who sets the table? Takes out the garbage? Cleans up the bathroom? How are the bank accounts set up and managed? Who shops for groceries? Clothes? Furniture? Who pays for what? Who adopts responsibility for the taxes? Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Two hundred things, perhaps, to run a <a class="ref" href="/topics/household">Household</a> properly—as complex a problem as running a business, with the additional difficulty of trying to manage it with a <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a> member, much of it repeated daily. Your life is, after all, mostly composed of what is repeated routinely. You either negotiate responsibility for every single one of these duties or you play push and pull forever, while you battle it out nonverbally, with stubbornness, silence, and half-hearted attempts at “cooperation.” That is not going to do your romantic situation any good. It is of vital necessity, in consequence, to place the domestic part of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/household">Household</a> economy on firm ground.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/reading-alasdair-macintyres-after-virtue">📙 Reading Alasdair MacIntyre’s After Virtue</a></h3><div><blockquote>In Homeric, Icelandic, and Irish heroic societies, moral life and social life were inseparable, for one’s social role and status, one’s work and deeds, and one’s relationships to <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a> and community were the main elements of personal identity. The Greek term “aretê,” which we translate as “virtue” meant “excellence” in strength and skill as well as character, and courage, defined as “the quality necessary to sustain a <a class="ref" href="/topics/household">Household</a> and a community” was a central form of excellence</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-master-and-his-emissary">📙 The Master and His Emissary</a></h3><div><blockquote>Since Dasein is ‘to be there’ in the world – the literal, actual, concrete, daily world – to be human at all is to be immersed in the earth, and the quotidian matter-of-factness of the world.
