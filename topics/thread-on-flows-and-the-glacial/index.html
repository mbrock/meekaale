another simile: nirvana is likened with "light that doesn't land anywhere" </p><p id="ZtsQHqc7-">the deepest contrast to orthodox sutric monastic buddhism is probably the "Calvinist work ethic" where constant productive participation in creation and causation, enlivened by the spirit of the prime mover God, is the only proof of salvation </p><p id="Pa670-5UA">(although probably a similar tendency exists in the Buddhism directed at laypeople rather than monastics: good productive work and householding is good karma, so at least you'll be reborn in a better situation until you become a monk and a buddha in ten thousand years) </p><p id="gJ49xNXAv">ADHD would be a disorder of the flowing ecosystem where the flow tends to be both strong and chaotic, so you can  unintentionally enter flow states that are hard to get out of

noting also that narcolepsy is treated with Ritalin </p><p id="T-cjvimTH">for me Ritalin is useful because it helps with making decisions in a faster and more confident way, and then sustaining those decisions in a flowing way

as if there's a plumbing manifold with narcoleptic tendencies that the methylphenidate keeps awake https://t.co/inGGWeTQSy </p><p id="mTGuAq-jv">oh apparently last year there was a study where "findings indicate that ADHD and narcolepsy are genetically related, and there are possible common underlying biological mechanisms for this relationship"

https://t.co/1wqCpa9WXQ </p><p id="CkHb8NRaN">"The prevalence of ADHD in individuals with narcolepsy is ~35% higher than in the general population (~5%). Furthermore, psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate, are effective for controlling symptoms of ADHD (first-line approved treatment) and narcolepsy" </p><p id="FQKrmNgje">sleep as a kind of involuntary flow with similarities to hyperfocus brings up Dreyfus and his take on sleep as a divine gift in Homeric polytheism, and how we can't truly take credit for the way life flows  https://t.co/JJVU5xftlr </p><p id="KpkMVdVk9">for Dreyfus, "the most important things [...] well up and take us over, hold us for a while, and then, finally, let us go" and "in Homer's world what whooshes up is what really shines and matters most"

https://t.co/mswFIJODzq </p><p id="GhUpLiJ3t">so in our world we don't think in terms of Olympic gods, but we can think with the framework of neurotransmitters

https://t.co/dWWJco5SO9 </p><p id="GJKyM8e7k">so it's not that I'm not properly attuned to divine whooshing, I simply have a disorder in the biological system that regulates the flow of dopamine </p><p id="jAlGYbImu">noting that the most prototypical metaphor for the goal of Buddhism is "awakening"

noting that Vervaeke was probably careful in choosing the title "awakening from the meaning crisis"

noting Dreyfus writing that in the Iliad, sleep is the "lord of all gods and of all men" </p></div></section></article></html>
