But like a carving knife is also a “medium” so this aspect is more than just “consuming” media passively </p><div class="indent"></div><p>It’s related to attention, action, perception, chasing, intentionality, inspiration, and the “channeling” or “tunneling” of all these things, and also their relaxation and broadening </p><div class="indent"></div><p>A key term in a negative sense would be “frustration”, like general flow is the type of human intentional process that can be frustrated?

I know it’s an extremely broad and vague category, maybe uselessly so </p><div class="indent"></div><p>“Intentional process” from @ae_play is good but I realize I want my category to be even more vague than what I have described so far 🤠

I want to include the Alexander Technique thing of relaxing unnecessary bodily tension by widening one’s awareness of space </p><div class="indent"></div><p>I would probably just end up calling it “energetic flows” or something lame like that, pseudoscientific concept that means everything and nothing 🤷‍♂️ </p><div class="indent"></div><p>Bad philosophy at 2:30 AM by @meekaale your welcome </p><div class="indent"></div></div></section></article></html>
