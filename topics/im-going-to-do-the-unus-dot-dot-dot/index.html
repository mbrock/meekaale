This is the version of it articulated by Deleuze in Difference & Repetition, which then bleeds into his work with Guattari in Anti-Oedipus. https://t.co/uZ2HXIE8lt https://t.co/UUEUau9168</p><div class="indent"><p><strong>Note</strong>: Thread</p><div class="indent"></div></div><p>In D&R Deleuze defends a metaphysical theory of time that weaves together a dizzying array of references that are often hard to distinguish and integrate: from Hume and Bergson to Nietzsche and Freud, biology and psychoanalysis to dynamic systems theory and thermodynamics.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>If you want to see an outline of this theory stripped of its stranger references and reconnected to more classical problems in the metaphysical tradition (Plato, Aristotle, Leibniz, Kant...) and restricted to DST, check out my 'Ariadne's Thread' talk: https://t.co/tQD2SQGQ4U</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Here I'm going to try and trace the connection between Nietzsche, thermodynamics, and psychoanalysis contained in the third synthesis of time, called both death drive and eternal return in D&R, and discussed as 'Aion' in opposition to 'Chronos' in the Logic of Sense.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>I'll then try to tie this metaphysics back to the explanatory and normative concerns of psychology and psychoanalysis specifically, in a way that lines up with Ray's concerns in Nihil Unbound and my rearticulation of them in my 'Beyond Survival' talk: https://t.co/M6RlJ2896o</p><div class="indent"></div><p>So, what's at issue here? How could we possibly find a connection between these disparate notions? We have to begin with the key terms: identity/difference and order/chaos, for it is only in terms of these that any notion of death, and thereby life, might be articulated.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Let's take identity first.

Selfhood is not simply given, selfhood requires (often unpleasant) work.
