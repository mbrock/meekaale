This is the most general conception of mental health. But Watkins, and her mentor James Hillman, ask the question ‚ÄòWhy?‚Äô Would it not make more sense to live with multiplicity, to recognize more than one centre within ourselves? Hillman suggests that this quarrel is rather like the quarrel between <a class="ref" href="/topics/monotheism">Monotheism</a> and <a class="ref" href="/topics/polytheism">Polytheism</a>. Psychology, he says, is secretly monotheistic, and wants everything to be neatly hierarchical or bureaucratic. But could we not envisage a polytheistic psychology, which admitted that there could be many gods and goddesses, many egos, many identities, many selves. <a class="cite" href="/books/subpersonalities#Bca9KWhKV" title="Go to quote">*</a></blockquote><blockquote>It is necessary to lift your eyes above the horizon, to establish a transcendent goal, if you wish to cease being a puppet, under the control of things you do not understand and perhaps do not want to understand. Then all the subsystems or subpersonalities that might otherwise be pursing their own limited fulfillment will join together under the aegis of the truly ideal, and the consequence of that will be an engagement that approximates the ultimate or total. Under such conditions, all the parts of you are going to be on board. That is the psychological equivalent of <a class="ref" href="/topics/monotheism">Monotheism</a>. That is the emergence of the higher self that might be the true servant of God, in whatever metaphysical reality potentially underlies what is obvious to our blind and limited mortal selves. <a class="cite" href="/books/beyond-order#miZ5A0r10" title="Go to quote">*</a></blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/all-things-shining">üìô All Things Shining</a></h3><div><blockquote>To lure back these Homeric gods is a saving possibility after the death of God: it would allow us to survive the breakdown of <a class="ref" href="/topics/monotheism">Monotheism</a> while resisting the descent into a nihilistic existence.</blockquote><blockquote>Melville‚Äôs genuine wickedness, in other words, consists in his portrayal of Ahab‚Äôs monomaniacal <a class="ref" href="/topics/monotheism">Monotheism</a> as itself the incarnation of what the universe most abhors.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/beyond-order">üìô Beyond Order</a></h3><div><blockquote>It is necessary to lift your eyes above the horizon, to establish a transcendent goal, if you wish to cease being a puppet, under the control of things you do not understand and perhaps do not want to understand.

Powell has given us a clear notion of just how deep this essentialist view runs in Western philosophy: ‚ÄúThe dominant narrative of Western society . . . denies that we are or can be multiple and fractured and still remain ‚Äònormal‚Äô . . . its individualistic focus is one of the deeply rooted ideologies of Western society . . . [and] the individualistic norm . . . pervades our society.‚Äù38 Combined with and reinforced by the dominance of <a class="ref" href="/topics/monotheism">Monotheism</a>, the essentialist view provides a powerful philosophical foundation for the Single Self Assumption.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
