It doesnâ€™t cohere outwards, itâ€™s not meant for others, itâ€™s often secret and confidential. </p><p>My <a class="ref" href="/topics/story">Story</a> should be something that people could tell in broad strokes, maybe after my death, in an <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> and hopefully nice way. That wouldnâ€™t be a <a class="ref" href="/topics/story">Story</a> of my confidential inner turmoils, etcâ€”it would be about who I was, what I did, what I said. </p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/experiences-of-depression">ðŸ“™ Experiences of Depression</a></h3><div><blockquote>I will offer a tentative account of another kind of <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> disturbance, one that I think occurs in at least some cases of <a class="ref" href="/topics/depression">Depression</a>. Here, the person needs a <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a>, principally one about where she is going and how she is going to tackle various tasks, but she cannot formulate one because there is no sense that the future could be any different. However, what results is not an absence of <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> thought. Instead, there is a cacophony of disordered thoughts as she struggles to form a coherent <a class="ref" href="/topics/story">Story</a> that cannot take shape. Thoughts go round and round without any efficacy, like a car engine that is out of gear.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/learning-from-macintyre">ðŸ“™ Learning From MacIntyre</a></h3><div><blockquote>But MacIntyre understands <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> in a different way: Reflective agents thus increasingly understand themselves and others in terms of a certain kind of <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a>, a <a class="ref" href="/topics/story">Story</a> in which they as agents direct themselves or fail to direct themselves toward a final end, the nature of which they initially apprehend in and through their activities as rational agents.</blockquote><blockquote>In <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> so construed, we do not need an <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> plot with a beginning, middle and end: we do not all have to be Aristotelian tragic heroes. Rather, <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> for MacIntyre, is a <a class="ref" href="/topics/story">Story</a> of repetition and re-creation: of our repeated efforts to get clearer on, perhaps revise and shape, and try to achieve our final ends.</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-spell-of-the-sensuous">ðŸ“™ The Spell of the Sensuous</a></h3><div><blockquote>The telling of stories, like singing and praying, would seem to be an almost ceremonial act, an ancient and necessary mode of speech that tends the earthly rootedness of human language. For narrated events, as Basso reminds us, always happen somewhere. And for an oral culture, that locus is never merely incidental to those occurrences. The events belong, as it were, to the place, and to tell the <a class="ref" href="/topics/story">Story</a> of those events is to let the place itself speak through the telling.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
