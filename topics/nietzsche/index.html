Why does he never find any objective good with authority over him in the social world to date? The answer is not difficult: <a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>â€™s portrait makes it clear that he who transcends is wanting in respect of both relationships and activities.</blockquote><blockquote>The attractiveness of Nietzcheâ€™s position lay in its apparent honesty. When I was setting out the case in favor of an amended and restated emotivism, it appeared to be a consequence of accepting the truth of emotivism that an honest man would no longer want to go on using most, at least, of the language of past morality because of its misleading character. And <a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a> was the only major philosopher who had not flinched from this conclusion. Since moreover the language of modern morality is burdened with pseudo-concepts such as those of utility and of natural rights, it appeared that <a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>â€™s resoluteness alone would rescue us from entanglement by such concepts; but it is now clear that the price to be paid for this liberation is entanglement in another set of mistakes. The concept of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>an â€˜great manâ€™ is also a pseudo-concept, although not always perhapsâ€”unhappilyâ€”what I earlier called a fiction. It represents individualismâ€™s final attempt to escape from its own consequences. And the <a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>an stance turns out not to be a mode of escape from or an alternative to the conceptual scheme of liberal individualist <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a>, but rather one more representative moment in its internal unfolding. And we may therefore expect liberal individualist societies to breed â€˜great menâ€™ from time to time. Alas!</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/hyperobjects">ðŸ“™ Hyperobjects</a></h3><div><blockquote>Malcolm Bull has written a very powerful escape manual for lame creatures who want to exit <a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>an modernity, entitled Anti-<a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>.</blockquote></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
