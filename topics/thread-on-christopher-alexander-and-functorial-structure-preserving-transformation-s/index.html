<a class="ref" href="/topics/christopher-alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>’s “structure-preserving transformations” take place within a domain, like a function of type Drawing → Drawing

there are also SPTs between domains, like Flower → Drawing </p><div class="indent"></div><p>it seems nice to think of drawing a flower as a structure-preserving transformation

one reason is that you can choose what aspect of the structure to preserve

you don’t need to judge the drawing on overall realism, but by how well it translates some important “structure” </p><div class="indent"></div><p>Picasso abstract bull is a great example of course https://t.co/OmxkDvc53W </p><div class="indent"></div><p>(and of course this is also a series of Drawing → Drawing structure-preserving transformations, repeated applications of an essentializing process) </p><div class="indent"></div><p>I thought of this while thinking about the process of inventing an “app”

Like, yeah you can be agile and do repeated Program → Program SPTs

But also you can think of how to solve the problem at hand with some kind of Reality → Computer SPT </p><div class="indent"></div><p>so what easy and relatively harmonious process could I use to transpose my problem in reality into some computer representation that somehow vividly “gets the gist” of the thing, like an abstract bull drawing </p><div class="indent"></div></div></section></article></html>
