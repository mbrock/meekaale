A symbol for Vervaeke is not just any linguistic signifier or an algebraic variable. It's more like the kind of use in "the lion is a symbol of strength" or the Christian cross.</p><p>Vervaeke's first example of a <a class="ref" href="/topics/symbol">Symbol</a> in this sense is the scales of justice. He looks at that <a class="ref" href="/topics/symbol">Symbol</a> from an embodied cognitive science perspective, claiming that it's not just a nice metaphor. The <a class="ref" href="/topics/symbol">Symbol</a> identifies justice as involving <em>balance</em>, and we can use the link to the vivid embodied image of the scales to activate our actual capacity for balance. Physical balancing is associated with the brain's cerebellum, and Vervaeke explains that attuning to the <a class="ref" href="/topics/symbol">Symbol</a> of the scales is a way to light up these neural circuits to bring our learned sense of balancing to bear when making ethical decisions.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/2021-03-29">March 29th, 2021</a></h3><div><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/symbol">Symbol</a>s gather our cognition, our thoughts and associations, into coherent emblems, full of meaning yet consisting of very little in themselves.

There is the imagination that one uses in one‚Äôs ordinary perception of the world. This ‚Äúordinary‚Äù imagination enables one to take for granted those things that one needs to be able to rely on. But there is also the imagination that is inventive and revolutionary, perceiving objects as <a class="ref" href="/topics/symbol">Symbol</a> of things beyond themselves. This latter, ‚Äúcreative‚Äù dimension is described by one Christian philosopher as the ability ‚Äúto see simultaneously what is and what might yet be for the best, to engage at the same time the most creative of human passions, and consequently to lure into action and to sustain commitment.‚Äù4</blockquote></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-biology-of-desire">üìô The Biology of Desire</a></h3><div><blockquote>It took Johnny about four years to shift from normal drinking to serious drinking, as he calls it.

Alcohol became a <a class="ref" href="/topics/symbol">Symbol</a>, the core of a network that included a promise of <a class="ref" href="/topics/peace">Peace</a>, cessation of stress, relaxation.
