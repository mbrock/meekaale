Yesterday we took bikes across the river to dwell for some days in this Airbnb house for a change of scenery. I forgot to bring some things, including my laptop charger. I'm down to 11%. </p><div class="indent"></div><p>On the way out from our apartment yesterday, a can of Estonian birch-flavored lager suddenly exploded in my backpack, and my space bar has a hangover.  But I want to write something brief. </p><div class="indent"></div><p>I was thinking about how a human being is such a strange and powerful object, especially in the capacity for intentional drives that last many years.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>A motorcycle is also quantifiably powerful, but its behavior is simple. </p><div class="indent"></div><p>Here's a ridiculous comparison: a person is like an extremely advanced robot hooked up to an artificial general intelligence. It's ridiculous because robots and AIs are just our attempts to make things similar to us, so there's almost no information content in the analogy. </p><div class="indent"></div><p>In <a class="ref" href="/books/guerrilla-metaphysics"> Guerrilla Metaphysics</a>, <a class="ref" href="/topics/graham-harman">Graham Harman</a> makes a big deal of <a class="ref" href="/topics/metaphor">Metaphor</a>. One point he makes is that you can't make a powerful metaphor out of things that are already comparable. </p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>“The cypress is a conifer” fails as metaphor precisely because the names can be fused together with ease; “the cypress is a flame” succeeds only because they cannot. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>So how about "the human is an extremely sophisticated artificially intelligent robot" as a metaphor? Maybe it has some power; maybe those two concepts <em>can't</em> be fused together with ease. Humans and robots are distinctly fascinating objects, and it's a perennial problem how to distinguish people from automatons.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>When a metaphor works, we see the two elements in a new way:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Since the two images are unable actually to melt together instantly by way of their truly minimal common qualities, the cryptic essences that my life senses in them remain before me in a kind of permanent collision. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Powerful intelligent robots are always menacing. But humans can also be extremely dangerous, and not just in the manner of a bulldog. We can make long-term schemes and use our cleverness to cause truly immense problems.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>In <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a>, <a class="ref" href="/topics/alasdair-macintyre">Alasdair MacIntyre</a> points out that we have a double nature of trying to render the outer world predictable while preserving our own unpredictability.</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>It is necessary, if life is to be meaningful, for us to be able to engage in long-term projects, and this requires predictability; it is necessary, if life is to be meaningful, for us to be in possession of ourselves and not merely to be the creations of other people’s projects, intentions and desires, and this requires unpredictability. <strong>We are thus involved in a world in which we are simultaneously trying to render the rest of society predictable and ourselves unpredictable</strong>, to devise generalizations which will capture the behavior of others and to cast our own behavior into forms which will elude the generalizations which others frame. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p>We are powerful and dangerous, but in a way that also makes it possible for our benevolence to transform the world.</p><div class="indent"></div></div></section><section><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/im-going-to-do-the-unus-dot-dot-dot">I'm Going to Do the Unus...</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/february-28th-2021">February 28th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/february-28th-2021">February 28th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/prayer"> Prayer</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/february-28th-2021">February 28th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
