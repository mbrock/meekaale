"Come in," she said, "I'll give ya shelter from the storm."</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p><a class="ref" href="/topics/graham-harman">Graham Harman</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>All reality unfolds in the interior of an object—or rather, in the interiors of countless objects, stretching above and below each other indefinitely. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p><a class="ref" href="/topics/venkatesh-rao">Venkatesh Rao</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>So those of you who weren’t already in <a class="ref" href="/articles/domestic-cozy"> Domestic Cozy</a> mode, welcome to the Great Indoors. Wash your hands and settle in. This ain’t as bad as you think. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Yesterday for some reason this thought appeared in my mind: there's politics on both the inside and the outside of every object.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Inside my mind, as I learn from <a class="ref" href="/topics/internal-family-systems">Internal Family Systems</a>, there's a multitude of agents with their own desires and conflicts, but I don't usually see it like this because I'm biased against my own multiplicity.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Firms and organizations have office politics especially when they claim they're "flat" or "structureless."</p><div class="indent"></div><p>There seems to be a very general pattern of wanting the inside of an object to be smooth, unified, and cozy. And it seems like this can often lead to attempted melting of the distinct parts, suppression of difference, and ontological confusion.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Romantic love provides one example.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Erich Fromm's 1956 book <a class="ref" href="/books/the-art-of-loving"> The Art of Loving</a> starts with the basic impulse to join together as fundamental to human life.</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>This desire for interpersonal fusion is the most powerful striving in man. It is the most fundamental passion, it is the force which keeps the human race together, the clan, the family, society. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>But the relationship conceived as a cozy shelter from the outside world is a mistake.</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>In “love” one has found, at last, a haven from aloneness. One forms an alliance of two against the world, and this egoism <em>à deux</em> is mistaken for love and intimacy. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>A mature loving relationship can have a cozy interior, but it can't be completely and permanently cozy. That would only be possible if the two people who enact the relationship could actually fuse and merge into one smooth interiority.</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Love, experienced thus, is a constant challenge; it is not a resting place, but a moving, growing, working together; even whether there is harmony or conflict, joy or sadness, is secondary to the fundamental fact that two people experience themselves from the essence of their existence, that they are one with each other by being one with themselves, rather than by fleeing from themselves. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>In the first decade of the 1900s, Rilke wrote about this theme in the <a class="ref" href="/topics/letters-to-a-young-poet">Letters to a Young Poet</a>, in a grandiose mode appropriate for a young romantic poet:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Loving does not at first mean merging, surrendering, and uniting with another person (for what would a union be of two people who are unclarified, unfinished, and still incoherent?), it is a high inducement for the individual to ripen, to become something in himself, to become world, to become world in himself for the sake of another person; it is a great, demanding claim on him, something that chooses him and calls him to vast distances. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>He describes the marriages of his time as "filled with error," but he saw a new form of love on the horizon.</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>And this more human love (which will fulfill itself with infinite consideration and gentleness, and kindness and clarity in binding and releasing) will resemble what we are now preparing painfully and with great struggle: the love that consists in this: that <strong>two solitudes protect and border and greet each other</strong>. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>I'm trying to think about this through a kind of <a class="ref" href="/topics/object-oriented-ontology">Object-Oriented Ontology</a> lens. </p><div class="indent"></div><p>Timothy Morton writes in <a class="ref" href="/books/humankind"> Humankind</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Ontologically, a married couple is smaller than two unmarried people. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>If the inside of a relationship can't be made cozy by melting the individuals, what are good and true ways to nurture that inside space?</p><div class="indent"></div></div></section><section><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/jordan-peterson-jonathan-pageau-pastoral-commentary-on-the-first-hour">Jordan Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, Pastoral Commentary on the First Hour</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-4th-2021">March 4th, 2021</a>.</p><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-4th-2021">March 4th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/tool-being">Tool-Being</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-4th-2021">March 4th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/body-pleasure"> Body Pleasure</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-4th-2021">March 4th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/conceptual-engineering-the-revolution-in-philosophy-youve-never-heard-of---lesswrong"> Conceptual Engineering: The Revolution in Philosophy You've Never Heard of -
