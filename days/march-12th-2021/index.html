Or rather I see this heteronym in my mind already and I'm curious about letting him speak.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Timothy Morton wrote about the idea that evil is the gaze that views the world as evil while standing aside from it as a pure and innocent soul.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>My heteronym is evil in that sense. He would write something like this:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>It is an error to say that there is evil in the world. Rather, the world is evil from the beginning and evil sustains it. There's so much evil in the very foundation of the world that identifying a specific evil is almost a kind of propaganda that conceals evil's enormity. Energy, industry, technology, numbers and alphabets, birth and death, love, perception, agency: everything is suffused with evil. Our ability to carry out our daily lives without being overwhelmed by evil is itself, of course, evil.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>He is also a bit pretentious, but who isn't?</p><div class="indent"></div><p>I don't know his name yet.</p><div class="indent"></div></div></section><section><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/7-ways-of-reading-philosophy-an-introduction"> 7 Ways of Reading Philosophy: An Introduction</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-12th-2021">March 12th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/experiences-of-depression"> Experiences of Depression</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-12th-2021">March 12th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/phenomenology-and-virtue-ethics"> Phenomenology and Virtue Ethics</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-12th-2021">March 12th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/sources-of-the-self"> Sources of the Self</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-12th-2021">March 12th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-faithful-buddhist"> The  Faithful Buddhist</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-12th-2021">March 12th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-hierarchy-of-heaven-and-earth"> The Hierarchy of Heaven and Earth</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-12th-2021">March 12th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
