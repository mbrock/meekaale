If we are not, as we once imagined bound by the gravity of an inner core, what keeps us from flying to pieces? What keeps our healthy multiplicity from dissolving into unhealthy splitting, or even fragmentation? . . . There is a thread, or threads, holding together the fabric of our mental lives. . . . Rather than identifying this thread as a singular conscious identity formation, I proposed a metaphor for the multiple self as braid, whose strength derives precisely from the interweaving of its disparate conscious and unconscious threads. . . . This web or net of threads, taken together, constitutes a “whole”—but a whole whose very coherence and binding power is made up of our multiple subjective experiences and states of being-in-relation. <a class="cite" href="/books/your-symphony-of-selves#ymz9bEPNf" title="Go to quote">*</a></blockquote><p id="DkCs6zur9">I suppose these threads must be related to narratives.</p><h3 id="UMCXGpICF">Plotoids</h3><p id="Mcg20UfSa">Coping with a tangle of <a class="ref" href="/topics/plotoids">Plotoids</a> was the theme of <a class="blockref" href="/days/2021-02-26#c3ZRMQ_Kf" title="February 26th, 2021">📝 Losing the Plot — Ethics and The Big Lebowski</a>.</p><p id="NYM72BEWs">The plot of <a class="ref" href="/topics/the-big-lebowski">The Big Lebowski</a> starts with a dramatic scene where a gang of confused thugs, having mistaken the stoner protagonist for a wealthy old man with the same last name, break into his house and end up pissing on the beautiful rug that "really tied the room together."</p><p id="xuqb5Psg4">Of course I suggest that the "desecration" of the Dude's rug symbolizes the breakdown in coherent overarching narratives, and when the Dude complains about having "a lotta strands to keep in my head, man" he's describing a frazzled fabric of plotoids.</p><p id="QkiH2gcIM">The treatment of <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> in <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue">📙 After Virtue</a> can seem to imply a nostalgia for the great coherent narratives of ancient societies, but MacIntyre's pluralism promotes another understanding.

Then all the subsystems or subpersonalities that might otherwise be pursing their own limited fulfillment will join together under the aegis of the truly ideal, and the consequence of that will be an engagement that approximates the ultimate or total. Under such conditions, all the parts of you are going to be on board. That is the psychological equivalent of monotheism. That is the emergence of the higher self that might be the true servant of God, in whatever metaphysical reality potentially underlies what is obvious to our blind and limited mortal selves. <a class="cite" href="/books/beyond-order#miZ5A0r10" title="Go to quote">*</a></blockquote><p id="z0bcVNPX-">I have quite a few sources for other options.</p><p id="Tao7ITZ_l">From <a class="ref" href="/books/all-things-shining">📙 All Things Shining</a>:</p><blockquote id="216yvzBEy">The multiple meanings of the universe simply don’t add up to a single, universal truth.
