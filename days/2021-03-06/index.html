For a monolingual person, the "mother tongue" seems like it would be almost inextricably entangled in the upper level near "the self." Simler writes about single words (like "art"), saying</p><blockquote id="FD4jSJ1Mr">[...] a 'god' or 'spirit' in your brain has a lot more power than any word, because it's alive in there. It's a fully animated concept, with agency of its own. As it happens, words aren't completely dead and lifeless; they're just like little fledgling gods. They can pop to mind unbidden, shift in meaning, and become more or less salient. But they have nowhere near as much intelligence or independent agency as a hallucinated voice. <a class="cite" href="/articles/hallucinated-gods#O4pyxGgCy" title="Go to quote">*</a></blockquote><p id="QXvO6Z6eg">But a mother tongue is larger than a word. Indeed the hallucinated voices would typically be "subservient" to that language, in a sense. When Simler compares the Jaynesian gods with "slightly rogue agents" like addictions, the gods are more agentic because they can use language directly. This seems to suggest that language would be even further up the hierarchy than the self and the gods.</p><blockquote id="qQBX50mL4">The difference is that, in a typical modern brain, the rogue network exists at a much lower level, whereas the gods in a bicameral brain exist at (more or less) the same level as the self and, crucially, can call upon the language and reasoning faculties directly. <a class="cite" href="/articles/hallucinated-gods#-msjirJkZ" title="Go to quote">*</a></blockquote><p id="gUgwG_3on">I know someone who grew up with two languages, Latvian and Russian, and who describes themselves as feeling somewhat split between the two. Each language is associated with one parent: there's a mother tongue and a father tongue, two different cultures, two parts of her self.</p><p id="QfRAXXEL6">Thinking about inner multiplicity like this, it seems natural to also think about the structures associated with <a class="ref" href="/topics/project">Project</a>s, interests, and vocations. I am a programmer but also a woodworker. These have their own languages, values, worldviews. They aren't just "roles" in a social sense. They are structurally similar to addictions, gods, or selves.</p><p id="YZM0ka_Ql">My programmer part is an evolution of my general computer-using part. It's quite a core part for me because it flourished and peaked in my adolescence. In some ways it's stuck in adolescence, a kind of "exile" in IFS terms, perpetually 16 years old, wearing a Linux t-shirt and staying up past its bedtime.</p><p id="5Y02K0D9L">My woodworker part is a form of ancestor worship. It connects to my paternal lineage. In the Jaynesian way of being, it would be associated with a hallucinated ghost of my grandfather. My inner woodworker originates back in some fragmentary memories of tinkering in his basement, but as a living agent now it was born just a couple of years ago.</p><p id="UEHVcCHoW">In Kaj Sotala's article <a class="ref" href="/articles/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model">📰 Building Up to an Internal Family Systems Model</a>, he writes:</p><blockquote id="jG1Ie4kdg">I’ve frequently been very dysfunctional, and have always found very intuitive the notion of the mind being split into parts.
