In my small Swedish hometown, games like <em>Morrowind</em>, <em>Diablo</em>, and <em>Ultima Online</em> were like the fairytales of my adolescence, fantastic worlds of heroism, charm, and <a class="ref" href="/topics/salience">Salience</a>.</p><div class="indent"></div><h3>Horizontal Freedom and Vertical Quest</h3><div class="indent"></div><p>I see two different aspects of this kind of game that make them so interesting as a lens to look at life. Maybe we can call them the <a class="ref" href="/topics/horizontal">Horizontal</a> and the <a class="ref" href="/topics/vertical">Vertical</a> aspects. </p><div class="indent"></div><p>The <a class="ref" href="/topics/vertical">Vertical</a> is about <a class="ref" href="/topics/quest">Quest</a>, <a class="ref" href="/topics/plot">Plot</a>, and <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a>, while the <a class="ref" href="/topics/horizontal">Horizontal</a> is about <a class="ref" href="/topics/things">Things</a>, <a class="ref" href="/topics/places">Places</a>, and <a class="ref" href="/topics/characters">Characters</a>.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Gameplay happens in both the horizontal and vertical aspects. The primary way of playing "vertically" is to follow the <a class="ref" href="/topics/main-quest">Main Quest</a>. Playing "horizontally" is a more diverse mode: exploring, tinkering with your <a class="ref" href="/topics/equipment">Equipment</a>, fighting critters just to boost your skills, etc.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>I see the <a class="ref" href="/topics/horizontal">Horizontal</a> as <a class="ref" href="/topics/phenomenology">Phenomenology</a> and the <a class="ref" href="/topics/vertical">Vertical</a> as <a class="ref" href="/topics/teleology">Teleology</a>.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>I think my main philosophical interest is how those two relate to each other.</p><div class="indent"></div><h3>The Freedom of Open Worlds</h3><div class="indent"></div><p>In adventure games, there's the notion of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/open-world">Open World</a>, which I wrote about a few days ago in <a href="/days/february-25th-2021"><strong>Note</strong>: The Charm of Open-World Games</a>. </p><div class="indent"></div><p>The main feature of <a class="ref" href="/topics/open-world-games">Open-World Games</a> is that they open up the <a class="ref" href="/topics/horizontal">Horizontal</a> aspect by making the <a class="ref" href="/topics/vertical">Vertical</a> aspect less predetermined. For the player, this is experienced in terms of <a class="ref" href="/topics/freedom">Freedom</a>.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>In the article <a class="ref" href="/articles/roam-free-a-history-of-open-world-gaming"> Roam Free: A History of Open-World Gaming</a>, we read:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>But to really classify a game as open world, it's got to be about freedom. There should be a sense that, within the rules of the game world, you can do anything at any time while freely moving about the space. It's essential for true open-world games to offer the freedom to decide when to do things, which by extension means a freedom to do things other than moving on to the next main story beat. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Life, then, is an open-world game, because we do experience that kind of freedom. Even in highly constrained situations, we feel <a class="ref" href="/topics/agency">Agency</a> instead of <a class="ref" href="/topics/determinism">Determinism</a>.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>But as we see in <a class="ref" href="/books/experiences-of-depression"> Experiences of Depression</a>, even this basic agentic freedom can be diminished. The depressed life is less “open” not because of external coercion, but through a malfunctioning in the <a class="ref" href="/topics/horizontal">Horizontal</a> aspect.</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/depression">Depression</a> involves a change in the kinds of possibility that are integral to experience, amounting to a diminishment of freedom. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>When the vertical aspect is removed altogether, the game becomes a <a class="ref" href="/topics/sandbox">Sandbox</a> or a <a class="ref" href="/topics/playground">Playground</a>. This is the style of play that Ian Bogost explores in his book <a class="ref" href="/books/play-anything"> Play Anything</a>, which is basically about seeing life as a vast open meta-playground.</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>A <a class="ref" href="/topics/playground">Playground</a> is a place where play takes place, and play is a practice of manipulating the things you happen to find in a <a class="ref" href="/topics/playground">Playground</a>. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Through <a class="ref" href="/books/experiences-of-depression"> Experiences of Depression</a>, we can see how a collapse of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/vertical">Vertical</a> can be an existential issue in forms of “manic” depression where salience and action are present but disconnected from larger structures.</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>A self that does not live into the future, that moves around in a merely playful way in the here and now, and, at best, still lives only from the past, is but momentarily ‘attuned’, not steadily advancing, developing or maturing, is not to borrow a word, an existential self. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><h3>Playing with <a class="ref" href="/topics/teleology">Teleology</a></h3><div class="indent"></div><p>So <a class="ref" href="/topics/open-world-games">Open-World Games</a> tend to emphasize the free play of <a class="ref" href="/books/unit-operations"> Unit Operations</a> in playground worlds, but that's not the whole story.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Here I think a quote from <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a> is a good provocation:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>There is no present which is not informed by some image of some future and an image of the future which always presents itself in the form of a <a class="ref" href="/topics/telos">Telos</a>—or of a variety of ends or goals—towards which we are either moving or failing to move in the present. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Sandboxes and playgrounds are places where children have fun and exercise their bodies and skills. We can see the implicit <a class="ref" href="/topics/teleology">Teleology</a>: the child is <em>growing</em> towards adolescence, adulthood, and civic participation.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>For <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>, that kind of child's play is the preliminary practice of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>. Health, strength, and agility are virtues developed through exercise. After childhood, we move from the playground to the <a class="ref" href="/topics/gymnasium">Gymnasium</a> to train these virtues further. Philosophical debate trains intellectual virtues. </p><div class="indent"></div><p>As described in <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a>, <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> has a <a class="ref" href="/topics/vertical">Vertical</a> axis centered around <a class="ref" href="/topics/flourishing">Flourishing</a> and the <a class="ref" href="/topics/common-good">Common Good</a>. Life may be a kind of playground, but it has structure and directionality.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>In games like <em>Morrowind</em>, there is a <a class="ref" href="/topics/main-quest">Main Quest</a> and a strong <a class="ref" href="/topics/vertical">Vertical</a> dimension, but the player isn't predetermined to follow it. There is a wide variety of <a class="ref" href="/topics/side-quests">Side Quests</a>.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>And in following the main quest, the player also encounters a rich and colorful <a class="ref" href="/topics/guild">Guild</a> system, drawn out in fantastic detail. </p><div class="indent"></div><p>There's a set of "imperial factions" which come from the traditions and politics of the Tamriel empire: the Imperial Knights with virtues of war, the Imperial Cult with virtues of religion, etc; and another rival set of "houses" from a different non-imperial civilization.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Of course <em>Morrowind</em> is inspired by medieval history, the Roman empire, and so on, so it's not surprising that we can look at it from the perspective of <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a>, which revolves around how modernity came to be so different from this type of world. MacIntyre talks about the medieval notion of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/quest">Quest</a>, and the notion of a <a class="ref" href="/topics/tradition">Tradition</a> as a community of practice is central to his argument.</p><div class="indent"></div><h3>Tentative Conclusion</h3><div class="indent"></div><p>I'm out of time for today. </p><div class="indent"></div><p>In the future, maybe tomorrow, I want to explore <a class="ref" href="/topics/macintyres-critique-of-modernity">MacIntyre’s Critique of Modernity</a> using this framework of <a class="ref" href="/topics/open-world-games">Open-World Games</a>.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>And I want to keep thinking about how all this relates to <a class="ref" href="/books/phenomenology-and-virtue-ethics"> Phenomenology and Virtue Ethics</a>.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>I'll end by just dragging in some relevant quotes to inspire thought:</p><div class="indent"><p>From <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a>:</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>The unity of a human life is the unity of a narrative quest. Quests sometimes fail, are frustrated, abandoned or dissipated into distractions; and human lives may in all these ways also fail. But the only criteria for success or failure in a human life as a whole are the criteria of success or failure in a narrated or to-be-narrated quest. A quest for what? <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>At the heart of the aesthetic way of life, as Kierkegaard characterizes it, is the attempt to lose the self in the immediacy of present experience. The paradigm of aesthetic expression is the romantic lover who is immersed in his own passion. By contrast the paradigm of the ethical is marriage, a state of commitment and obligation through time, in which the present is bound by the past and to the future. Each of the two ways of life is informed by different concepts, incompatible attitudes, rival premises. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>So when an institution—a <a class="ref" href="/topics/university">University</a>, say, or a farm, or a hospital—is the bearer of a tradition of practice or practices, its common life will be partly, but in a centrally important way, constituted by a continuous argument as to what a <a class="ref" href="/topics/university">University</a> is and ought to be or what good farming is or what good medicine is. Traditions, when vital, embody continuities of conflict. Indeed when a tradition becomes Burkean, it is always dying or dead. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Thus the <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a>s which we live out have both an unpredictable and a partially teleological character. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Mythology, in its original sense, is at the heart of things. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p>From <a class="ref" href="/books/the-utopia-of-rules"> The Utopia of Rules</a> by <a class="ref" href="/topics/david-graeber">David Graeber</a>:</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>One reason I have seen fit to spend so much time on fantasy worlds is because the topic opens up some fundamental questions about the nature of play, games, and freedom—all of which, I believe, lie at the core of <a class="ref" href="/topics/bureaucracy">Bureaucracy</a>’s covert appeal. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Administrative procedures are very much not about the creation of stories; in a <a class="ref" href="/topics/bureaucratic">Bureaucratic</a> setting, stories appear when something goes wrong. When things run smoothly, there’s no narrative arc of any sort at all. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>And of course by the time we get to Harry Potter, we have also traveled all the way from expressly heroic realms like Cimmeria or Elfland or Hyperborea, to an anti<a class="ref" href="/topics/bureaucratic">Bureaucratic</a> narrative that’s set within a classic <a class="ref" href="/topics/bureaucratic">Bureaucratic</a> institution: a British boarding school, in a magical world that is nonetheless replete with banks, Wizard Boards, Commissions of Enquiry, and even prisons. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>What ultimately lies behind the appeal of <a class="ref" href="/topics/bureaucracy">Bureaucracy</a> is fear of play. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></div></div></section><section><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/bedtime-reminiscences"> Bedtime Reminiscences</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-1st-2021">March 1st, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/inner-ring-as-adversary"> Inner Ring as Adversary</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-1st-2021">March 1st, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/self-criticism-vs-self-blame"> Self-Criticism vs Self-Blame</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-1st-2021">March 1st, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/who-controls-the-vertical-who-controls-the-horizontal"> Who Controls the Vertical?
