I can‚Äôt just look at it and take notes as if I were examining a train schedule. I have to orbit around it and let it affect me. I have to allow my own confusion as I rub against the thing to make sparks. Often nothing happens, my proud ambition runs up against a wall of cold despair, the glowing nexus of fascination I had felt seems like a mirage. Words fail to make contact with the alien entity that flits around in the outer atmosphere of my intellect making scintillating noises of obscure significance.</a></blockquote></p></div><p id="df6sDOz5L">Gendlin offers consolation to my own project:</p><div class="indent"><blockquote id="fRcWrGXtO">Suppose you are interviewing a rather shy person who hasn‚Äôt been allowed to say much for some time, perhaps some years.
