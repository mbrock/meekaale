I can just import those, and then tomorrow I can synthesize them into a notebook post, using the great feedback I got from @sashachapin.</a></p></div><p>Alright then‚Äîhere are my drafts. You can read them if you want, but they're mostly here for me to use as source material.</p><div class="indent"><p><a class="ref" href="/topics/gendlin-and-alexander-number-draft-1">Gendlin and Alexander: #Draft 1</a></p><p><a class="ref" href="/topics/gendlin-and-alexander-number-draft-2">Gendlin and Alexander: #Draft 2</a></p><p><a class="ref" href="/topics/gendlin-and-alexander-number-draft-3">Gendlin and Alexander: #Draft 3</a></p></div><p>What now? How do I take three different takes on a subject and compose a synthesis of them? I feel like I've already spent my time, effort, and caring budget on this project.</p><div class="indent"><p>It's actually a bit annoying that I <em>care</em> so much about this vague connection between two thinkers, while it also feels like hard work to draw out the resemblance.</p><p>That's also because both thinkers are a bit... mysterious? There's a kind of nausea I get when I write about this thing. The whole theme seems so precious, subtle, and possibly pretentious.</p><p>I have a feeling that no matter how much I write, I'll never get to the bottom of the thing, only scratch the surface aimlessly, and so all the text I produce amounts to nothing‚Äîbut this is pessimistic.</p><div class="indent"><p>In fact, as <a class="ref" href="/topics/at-sashachapin">@sashachapin</a> affirms coachingly, I've been a very good boy writing all these drafts, and quickly too.</p></div></div><p>Another problem is that I don't know what to call the thing I'm trying to write about.</p><div class="indent"><p>So far my only handle on it is "the thing that Gendlin and Alexander seem to have in common somehow."</p><p>I was attuned to this problem when I wrote the first draft.</p><div class="indent"><p><a class="blockref" href="/topics/gendlin-and-alexander-number-draft-1">Maybe what I‚Äôm doing now is trying to orient myself around a certain nameless sense of similarity between these two authors, as if they are both pointing towards something nebulous yet distinct which I can‚Äôt yet name.</a></p><p><a class="blockref" href="/topics/gendlin-and-alexander-number-draft-1">Now, I‚Äôll try to put the nameless thing in front of me. Instead of being sucked into it with an urgent anxious <em>need</em> to understand it, I can let it be there as it is, and only then can I start to probe it, relate to it, feel it out.</a></p><p>My solution then was to step back and use my imagination to create a scene of these two men meeting each other.</p><div class="indent"><p><a class="blockref" href="/topics/gendlin-and-alexander-number-draft-1">It seems to me that they would enjoy each other‚Äôs company. They both have a warmness, but combined with a kind of grandfatherly severity, a seriousness of purpose. They see a world that‚Äôs torn apart and made ugly by humanity‚Äôs ruptured attunement, modernity‚Äôs reductive analysis, the imposition of Patterns that fail to cohere and heal. And they have both spent decades developing practices that seem to border on the mystical, outside of mainstream practice, compelled to admit that they have discovered something vital and wholesome and forgotten.</a></p></div></div><p>Well, so‚ÄîI don't know what to call the thing? That's an appropriate problem, a problem that's the beating hidden heart of Gendlin's and Alexander's work: how can we address the nameless felt senses that pervade our lives?</p><p>In my second draft, I wrote this effusive paragraph:</p><div class="indent"><p><a class="blockref" href="/topics/gendlin-and-alexander-number-draft-2">Artists have to do this kind of thing all the time. Writing is also suffused with it. There‚Äôs something I‚Äôm trying to resolve, some problem I perceive not just as a logical puzzle but as a murky hopeful confusion in my whole being. I can‚Äôt just look at it and take notes as if I were examining a train schedule. I have to orbit around it and let it affect me. I have to allow my own confusion as I rub against the thing to make sparks. Often nothing happens, my proud ambition runs up against a wall of cold despair, the glowing nexus of fascination I had felt seems like a mirage. Words fail to make contact with the alien entity that flits around in the outer atmosphere of my intellect making scintillating noises of obscure significance.</a></p></div><p>Gendlin offers consolation to my own project:</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>Suppose you are interviewing a rather shy person who hasn‚Äôt been allowed to say much for some time, perhaps some years. You would not get impatient and yell at the person after five seconds. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote></div></div><p>There's a few different strands of this project:</p><div class="indent"><p>describing <a class="ref" href="/topics/eugene-gendlin">Eugene Gendlin</a>'s <a class="ref" href="/books/focusing">üìô Focusing</a>;</p><p>describing <a class="ref" href="/topics/christopher-alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>'s architectural practice;</p><p>describing <a class="ref" href="/topics/christopher-alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>'s wider aesthetic theory;</p><p>showing how Alexander's approach involves the same kind of attunement that Gendlin's method teaches;</p><p>exploring both thinkers' critiques of modernity; and</p><p>exploring what I think of as the "positive <a class="ref" href="/topics/teleology">Teleology</a>" of these practices.</p></div><p>I think this last point might be the most interesting. What does it mean?</p><div class="indent"><p>For Gendlin, the purpose of <a class="ref" href="/books/focusing">üìô Focusing</a> is not just to learn an interesting way to address and describe phenomena. The purpose is <em>therapeutic</em>, which means it aims at <em>health</em>. Not only that, but the method aims to show how the body is already attuned towards health, rightness, life.</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>It knows the direction. It knows this just as surely as you know which way to move a crooked picture. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote></div><p><a class="blockref" href="/topics/gendlin-and-alexander-number-draft-2">The body has intentions and desires. In a broad and general sense, it wants to go somewhere. It wants to set things straight. It has a directionality, some rudimentary Telos, an urge to cohere, persist, and flourish. Therapy ought to assist this innate yearning rather than impose some external schema. We need to learn to listen to our own perceptions.</a></p><p>Alexander‚Äôs practice revolves around moving things around until something clicks, until tensions are resolved and the body feels that the environment is becoming better, more joyful, more free. His work is building but he thinks of it as fundamentally a process of ‚Äúrepairing‚Äù the world, iteratively healing the site with <a class="ref" href="/topics/structure-preserving-transformation">Structure-Preserving Transformation</a>s that enhance its wholeness.</p><div class="indent"><p>(I mentioned this yesterday: <a class="blockref" href="/days/2021-02-22">Deep Laziness, Structure-Preserving Transformations, and Elaborated Time</a>.)</p></div><p>So this is the theme I felt happiest to discover while writing these drafts, and the one that seems to <em>point</em>, to indicate a <em>path</em>.</p><div class="indent"><p>With Gendlin, we learn to look in, toward the <a class="ref" href="/topics/felt-sense">Felt Sense</a> of the body, untangling inner knots and understanding ourselves.</p><p>With Alexander, we learn to look out, toward the environment, enhancing outer <a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a> and improving the world.</p><p>Both point in "the direction of healing and life <a class="cite" href="#">*</a>".</p></div><p>Alexander's fundamental concern is about relearning how to create living structure, how to stop making a world that's ugly and dead, so the future can be alive.</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>To create living structure in the environment of our age, and in the future age which stretches before us, we must now find ways of turning society beyond its too-regimented path, and towards paths of design and planning and construction which allow the life of every whole and the life of every part to emerge freely from the processes by which we make the world.</blockquote></div><p>The last section of Gendlin's book <a class="ref" href="/books/focusing">üìô Focusing</a> shows a similar hope, beyond the individual's private psychological healing:</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>Our structured institutions today offer little opportunity for personal living and speaking. The real living of people is mostly dulled and silent, inside them, alone [...] Focusing is only a piece of an answer. It lets people find their own inner source of direction. It can be a source of new <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>s, devised freshly by each individual [...] A society of <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>-makers is coming. It cannot help but be a society in which people are also more sensitive to, and intolerant of, social brutalities and oppressions, and more able to act to change them.</blockquote></div></div><p>I feel like I can leave this project for now.</p><div class="indent"><p>I've done what I can to sketch some outlines for what I think is not just a single cohesive article but more like a research program.</p><p>It's not like I'm moving on from Gendlin and Alexander; they'll always be part of my thinking and writing, in one way or another.</p><p>I didn't manage to craft an article to publish, but I did a lot of writing.</p></div></div></section><section class="mt-2"><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/readwise">Readwise</a></h3><div><p>On <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-23">February 23rd, 2021</a> at 9:50 AM Readwise synced 23 highlights from 3 books.</p><p>On <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-23">February 23rd, 2021</a> at 10:50 AM Readwise synced 17 highlights from 2 books.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/american-idle----remains-of-the-day">üì∞ American Idle ‚Äî Remains of the Day</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-23">February 23rd, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/awareness-is-a-user-interface-|-expanding-awareness-number-16">üì∞ Awareness Is a User Interface | Expanding Awareness #16</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-23">February 23rd, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/how-twitter-got-its-groove-back">üì∞ How Twitter Got Its Groove Back</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-23">February 23rd, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/inexhaustible-precision">üì∞ Inexhaustible Precision</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-23">February 23rd, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-book-of-disquiet">üìô The Book of Disquiet</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-23">February 23rd, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
