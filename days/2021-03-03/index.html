There are definitely areas of life and ethical questions where the available cultural wisdom seems inadequately coherent, so that young people tasked with creating their adult lives find themselves confused.</p><p>In what <a class="ref" href="/topics/david-chapman">David Chapman</a> calls the <a class="ref" href="/topics/choiceless">Choiceless</a> mode, decisions like whether to have a child or whether to attend a church were not agonizing self-created projects of lifestyle design, but, well, choiceless. One just did what one does.</p><p>Now, since whenever this damned <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> began, we are, as MacIntyre writes, "almost intolerably conscious of rival moral alternatives." The cultures we grow up in have tendencies towards <em>non-culture</em>. From <a class="ref" href="/books/reading-alasdair-macintyres-after-virtue">📙 Reading Alasdair MacIntyre’s After Virtue</a>:</p><blockquote>He finds the people of late <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> shifting toward a non-culture—a collection of competing individuals, who lack any shared conception of their goals as human beings. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><p>You can think of it as freedom or structurelessness, but for example the question of whether to give birth to a child is like a magmatic singularity of confusion if you think about it in the ethical terms that are floating around like debris in our culture.</p><p>In <a class="ref" href="/books/all-things-shining">📙 All Things Shining</a>, this kind of structureless choice is part of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/phenomenology">Phenomenology</a> of <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a>.</p><blockquote>The burden of <a class="ref" href="/topics/choice">Choice</a> is a peculiarly modern phenomenon. It proliferates in a world that no longer has any God or gods, nor even any sense of what is sacred and inviolable, to focus our understanding of what we are. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><p>One way to navigate this ocean of confusion is to engage in <a class="ref" href="/topics/teleological-archeology">Teleological Archeology</a>, trying to brush off and uncover some stable structure hidden beneath the arid sand dunes of non-culture.</p><p>It's a similar sense of <a class="ref" href="/topics/archeology">Archeology</a> as in <a class="ref" href="/topics/michael-ashcroft">Michael Ashcroft</a>'s video on finding your place as a contributor in a scene by assuming there's a big dinosaur skeleton of purpose that you can disclose.</p><p><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-M6Q6rI7JII"></iframe></p><p>The domain of Ashcroft's archeology is something like the social graph of collaboration and communication. It's teleological because there is a positive direction to the disclosing. The structure we're looking for is something like the <a class="ref" href="/topics/good">Good</a> for ourselves as part of a <a class="ref" href="/topics/common-good">Common Good</a>, or in a word, <a class="ref" href="/topics/eudaimonia">Eudaimonia</a>.</p><p>Another great piece of teleological archeology is <a class="ref" href="/topics/sarah-perry">Sarah Perry</a>'s <a class="ref" href="/articles/body-pleasure">📰 Body Pleasure</a>. It's devoted to disclosing the sustainable flourishing of the body's pleasure. Isn't this the most fundamental teleology, what we are essentially meant to pursue, even in religious worldviews?</p><p>Perry's essay anticipates a charge of selfish hedonism by showing one's own pursuit of sustainable pleasure to be a core practice of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/common-good">Common Good</a>. If you neglect your own body's pleasure, you've checked out of the common pursuit of well-being:</p><blockquote>Any person who accepts a life of low bodily pleasure and poor affect, even if he does so for beneficent reasons, is failing to contribute to group learning about pleasure, and failing to contribute to a cartel in which humans demand a floor level of bodily well-being—in a sense, scabbing against humanity. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><p>This is a fundamental project of teleological architecture because of course my own <a class="ref" href="/topics/body">Body</a> is my core domain, my most essential property and <a class="ref" href="/topics/home">Home</a>. </p><p>What does it mean to be <a class="ref" href="/topics/embodied">Embodied</a>? I suppose it implies being in tune with the body as a "ground of being," to live by the kind of wisdom that <a class="ref" href="/topics/eugene-gendlin">Eugene Gendlin</a> attributes to the body:</p><blockquote>Your body knows the direction of healing and life. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><p>So in <a class="ref" href="/articles/body-pleasure">📰 Body Pleasure</a>, we see a methodical and intelligent approach to taking bodily pleasure as a primary domain of inquiry and pursuit—a kind of "selfish" project that's been repressed for centuries.</p><blockquote>What are the best strategies for people who want to maximize pleasure in the long term? What is the best that human life can offer, at a very concrete and foundational level? These questions are little considered, in part because of Puritanical cultural norms, and in part because nobody thinks they are important. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><p>The wise practicality of <a class="ref" href="/articles/body-pleasure">📰 Body Pleasure</a> seems to make it a candidate for a kind of root source of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a>, a sketch for a basic curriculum in <a class="ref" href="/topics/flourishing">Flourishing</a>. Why does this seem outrageous? Because <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> is dead, and we killed him.</p></div></section><section class="mt-2"><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/1-slash-alright-this-is-an-exp-dot-dot-dot">1/Alright This Is an Exp...</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-03">March 3rd, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/jordan-peterson-jonathan-pageau-pastoral-commentary-on-the-first-hour">Jordan Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, Pastoral Commentary on the First Hour</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-03">March 3rd, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/body-pleasure">📰 Body Pleasure</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-03">March 3rd, 2021</a>.</p><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-03">March 3rd, 2021</a>.</p><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-03">March 3rd, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/shop-class-as-soulcraft">📰 Shop Class as Soulcraft</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-03">March 3rd, 2021</a>.</p><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-03">March 3rd, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/prayer">📙 Prayer</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-03">March 3rd, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-book-of-disquiet">📙 The Book of Disquiet</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-03">March 3rd, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
