Since that's infeasible, I have to make drastic simplifications. I have to make a caricature of my life, imposing a kind of cartoonish <a class="ref" href="/topics/ontology">Ontology</a>.</p><p id="pD66ld2id">The game will have distinct life-sized objects like shoes and eggplants. There will be some adequate graphical flux effects for clouds and water. My avatar's body will be capable of a limited repertoire of actions. The other beings in my life will be logical automata with random impulses. My cat will be a simple model of hunger, affection, and mischief.</p><p id="7mBRUUEDY">Games like Zelda, <a class="ref" href="/topics/the-sims">The Sims</a>, <a class="ref" href="/topics/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, and the text-based adventures of <a class="ref" href="/topics/interactive-fiction">Interactive Fiction</a> offer good examples of this kind of abstraction.</p><p id="EFGJQbqKs">Could such a game be a better representation of my life-world than a deep physical simulation?
