Then in university, while I myself knew struggles with <a class="ref" href="/topics/depression">Depression</a>, I read his short story <a class="ref" href="/topics/the-depressed-person">The Depressed Person</a> which is remarkably bleak and honest, especially about how the depressed person can know that they are burdening their friends, that they are in some way being very selfish, and how this deepens the <a class="ref" href="/topics/depression">Depression</a> even further: this recursion of dark self-centered alienation.</p><p>Then DFW develops a kind of philosophy of becoming happy by deciding to see everything as sacred, in a way... which didn't help against his own clinical <a class="ref" href="/topics/depression">Depression</a>. And Dreyfus sees this philosophy as fatally flawed, for basically phenomenological reasons related to the perception of salience.</p><div class="indent"><p>Some quotes:</p><div class="indent"><p><a class="blockref" href="/books/all-things-shining"><blockquote>his suicide is much more than the loss of a single, talented individual. It is a warning that requires our most serious attention. It is, indeed, the proverbial canary in the coal mine of modern existence.

(Location 844)</blockquote></a></p><p><a class="blockref" href="/books/all-things-shining"><blockquote>At the center of Homer’s world, then, is the sense that what matters is already given to us, and that the best life is the one that manages to get in sync with it. (Location 975)</blockquote></a></p><p><a class="blockref" href="/books/all-things-shining"><blockquote>The modern view that we are entirely responsible for our existence stands in radical contrast with the Homeric idea that we act at our best when we open ourselves to the world, allowing ourselves to be drawn from without. Indeed, once we see the force of this contrast it becomes obvious why the central Homeric phenomena are hard to find in our modern world. What Homer considers to be the paradigm of excellence seems to us hardly to count as human action at all.

Indeed the entire mode of existence that he castigated himself for not being strong enough to achieve, far from being the saving possibility for our culture, is in fact a human impossibility. Wallace’s inability to achieve it was not a weakness, but the deep and abiding humanness in his spirit.

In particular, I argue that Aquinas’s descriptions of the operation of these gifts have remarkable similarities to contemporary work in social cognition, especially the phenomenon of the joint attention of two persons, which has been described as a ‘meeting of Minds’ and ‘sharing an awareness of the sharing of focus.’ (Location 135)</blockquote></a></p></div><p>Both <a class="ref" href="/books/all-things-shining">📙 All Things Shining</a> and <a class="ref" href="/books/the-second-person-perspective-in-aquinass-ethics">📙 The Second-Person Perspective in Aquinas’s Ethics</a> make significant reference to <a class="ref" href="/topics/dante">Dante</a>'s vision of hell.</p><div class="indent"><p>The Aquinas book mentions how <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a> for Dante is in limbo, being perfectly virtuous but lacking the personal joint attention with God that Aquinas points at with the "gifts."</p></div><p>I should formulate questions around this.</p><div class="indent"><p>There's something about virtue, perception, effort and effortlessness...
