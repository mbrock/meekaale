The answer to this question – and the secret to their alliance – was their mutual distrust of identity. Deleuze and Guattari were both resolutely anti-individualist: whether in the realm of politics, psychotherapy or philosophy, they strived to show that the individual was a deception, summoned up to obscure the nature of reality. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>This kind of anti-individualism is not a position <em>against</em> individualism. It's not that we ought to be less self-centered, it's that we aren't individuals at all—not just an ethical claim but an ontological one.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Insofar as we see ourselves as individuals it's because we're participating in a scheme that tries desperately to maintain the paradigm of individuality, which is a struggle against reality, an ideological campaign.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>To escape from that scheme, Foucault's preface to <em>Anti-Oedipus</em> provides a tagline: </p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Free political action from all unitary and totalizing paranoia. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>I think it would be interesting to compare the Deleuzo-Guattarian project with MacIntyre's <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a>. They seem radically different in vibes and conclusions but there are some intriguing similarities.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>First, both projects are rooted in the "New Left" that tried to recover a liberatory Marxism from the totalitarian tragedy of Stalinism.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Thornton describes Guattari:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The reason for Guattari’s perpetual agitation can be summed up with a single phrase: ‘the threat of Stalinism’. Guattari saw how the collective will of the Russian Revolution had collapsed into the hierarchical power structure of bureaucratic state communism. Now, he saw the same process occurring in miniature in every group he joined. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>And here, from the book <a class="ref" href="/books/learning-from-macintyre"> Learning From MacIntyre</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>MacIntyre’s key and lasting contribution to New Left literature was to show how “common sense” Kantian responses to the evils of Stalinism were an inadequate basis upon which to rebuild an anti-Stalinist left. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Like Deleuze and Guattari, MacIntyre's project was to find a path beyond both individualism and Stalinism:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>He asked if “there can be an alternative to the barren opposition of moral individualism and amoral Stalinism.” Answering this question in the positive, he claimed that Marxists should follow Aristotle specifically, and the Greeks more generally, in linking ethics to human desires: “we make both individual deeds and social practices intelligible as human actions by showing how they connect with characteristically human desires, needs and the like.” <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>In the cultural reception, I think Deleuze and Guattari are associated with crazy flash-cut postmodernism, frantic accelerationism, rhizomatic hypermedia, incomprehensibility and psychosis, the polar opposite of Aristotelian virtue ethics. The "schizophrenic" aspect of the Deleuzo-Guattarian project projects a very different vibe from MacIntyre's ideal of a coherent polity of local communities.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>But this description of Guattari's practice in working with psychiatric patients suffering from the atomizing individualism of capitalism gives a different picture:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>At La Borde, his techniques included encouraging patients to participate in ‘therapeutic clubs’ for arts and theatre, where they could forge lasting relationships. When trying to give people the tools to reintegrate into society, Guattari said it was necessary to ‘build a new form of subjectivity that no longer relies on the individual.’ <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Deleuze and Guattari, like Marx, see capitalism as a tyranny that nevertheless builds the conditions for the social order that will replace it: communism, that is, a society where work is for the common good. They emphasize <em>desire</em> as a productive force. Capitalism liberates desire from the medieval structures that "melt into air" but also reterritorialize it and privatize it.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>This is also MacIntyre's basic view, as we see clearly in this quote from John Gregson's book about MacIntyre, called <a class="ref" href="/books/marxism-ethics-and-politics"> Marxism, Ethics and Politics</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>MacIntyre argued that capitalism potentially provided a ‘form of life’ through which people could ‘rediscover desire’ in such a way as to discover ‘above all what they want most is what they want in common with others.’. It was this socialized form of desire—the desire to be neither alienated from each other or ones’ self—that could potentially help individuals to discover that what they actually want are new forms of community and radically different social and economic arrangements. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>I'll try to continue this exploration later.</p><div class="indent"></div></div></section><section><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/jordan-peterson-jonathan-pageau-pastoral-commentary-on-the-second-hour">Jordan Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, Pastoral Commentary on the Second Hour</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-8th-2021">March 8th, 2021</a>.</p><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-8th-2021">March 8th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/anarchy-is-not-utopia"> Anarchy Is Not Utopia</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-8th-2021">March 8th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/beyond-order-by-jordan-peterson-review---more-rules-for-life-|-jordan-peterson-|-the-guardian"> Beyond Order by Jordan Peterson Review – More Rules for Life | Jordan Peterson | the Guardian</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-8th-2021">March 8th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/j-leif-no-citizens-abolishing-borders-beyond-the-nation-state"> J.
