Iâ€™ll let the fever of saying put me to sleep instead, and with closed eyes Iâ€™ll stroke, as if petting a cat, all that I might have said. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>All I can do is juxtapose some quotes. </p><div class="indent"></div><p>I would like to choose them carefully, but I don't even have time for that.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>From <a class="ref" href="/articles/the-government-within"> The Government Within</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>An integrated self, if it is anything, is a construction, an achievement, an emergent fact out of a pre-existing disorder, and one needs to understand this process in order to avoid or correct the pathologies that the process is prone to. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>From <a class="ref" href="/articles/neurons-gone-wild"> Neurons Gone Wild</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Most normal human brains, in normal environments, will naturally grow a single agent (the self) at the top of their agent hierarchy. But what if the brain or the environment isn't quite normal? Are we capable of growing other selves or person-like agents â€” even multiple ones in a single brain? <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>From <a class="ref" href="/topics/uses-of-disorder">Uses of Disorder</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The desire for coherent identity is exactly the search to avoid diversity and painful unknowns in the social arena for the sake of some secure order. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>From <a class="ref" href="/books/guerrilla-metaphysics"> Guerrilla Metaphysics</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Since all relations are objects, and all objects are formed in turn of a swarming internal empire of relations, the basic model of the world that results is both simple and endlessly pluralistic: namely, nothing exists but the interiors of objects, since objects are nothing but their interiors. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>From <a class="ref" href="/books/humankind"> Humankind</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>We donâ€™t have to agree that the Buddhist idea of no-self means that youâ€™re just a bunch of atoms. What it means instead is that you are open. You are a haunted house. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>From <a class="ref" href="/books/internal-family-systems-therapy"> Internal Family Systems Therapy</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The family therapy movement, which viewed extreme individual behaviors in the context of a larger system, liberated the field of mental health to focus on context and relationships. Internal Family Systems (IFS) takes this perspective further by viewing the psyche as a relational milieu that is populated by independent entities. IFS guides us to be curious about the motives and interactions of this inner populace, who have their own stories to tell. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>From <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Just as conflict is not central to a cityâ€™s life, but is reduced to a threat to that life, so tragedy as understood by Aristotle cannot come near the Homeric insight that tragic conflict is the essential human condition [...] <a class="cite" href="#">*</a> </blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>From <a class="ref" href="/articles/morality-for-exploded-minds"> Morality for Exploded Minds</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>My not-so-hidden agenda is to battle against the everyday notion of the self, the idea that at the core of a person is something simple and unitary. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>From Pope Francis, <a class="ref" href="/articles/angelus-30-june-2013"> Angelus, 30 June 2013</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The conscience is the interior place for listening to the truth, to goodness, for listening to God; it is the inner place of my relationship with him, the One who speaks to my heart and helps me to discern, to understand the way I must take and, once the decision is made, to go forward, to stay faithful. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>From <a class="ref" href="/articles/interiority-of-human-persons"> Interiority of Human Persons</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The inside of the rock is as external as the outer surface of it; the rock is incapable of that dimension of being that we call interiority. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>From <a class="ref" href="/books/a-new-philosophy-of-society"> A New Philosophy of Society</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Today, the main theoretical alternative to organic totalities is what the philosopher Gilles Deleuze calls assemblages, wholes characterized by relations of exteriority. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>From <a class="ref" href="/books/bankei-zen"> Bankei Zen</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The voices of the crows and sparrows, the rustling of the windâ€”you hear them without making any mistake about them, and thatâ€™s whatâ€™s called hearing with the Unborn. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>From <a class="ref" href="/topics/on-having-no-head">On Having No Head</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>A child is apt to ask why others have heads and he hasnâ€™t, or declare that heâ€™s nothing, not present, invisible.
