I have to figure out how to install the cargo bike's rain tent while baby naps, and later tonight we'll be enjoying our holiday, so today is a good day to exercise the option to write a very quick daily post. </p><p id="IExoO2aw-">After all, my basic goal is just to write one sentence:</p><blockquote id="9uUyRhA5C">The daily writing practice I’d advocate for is to write <strong>at least one sentence</strong>, as close to every day as you can manage, in a location that gives you the opportunity to easily write something closer to a short essay should you choose to do so. <a class="cite" href="/articles/a-guide-to-starting-a-daily-writing-practice#-3SatNiy8" title="Go to quote">*</a></blockquote><p id="weCrg8XGL">I've been mentioning <a class="ref" href="/topics/david-chapman">David Chapman</a>'s use of the terms <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a> and <a class="ref" href="/topics/nebulosity">Nebulosity</a>, like in yesterday's post about plot:</p><p id="jiXb05fwQ">((tlQDGSvNg))</p><p id="8_jYgsiui">Today it struck me that I think there's a tendency to basically associate <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a> with <a class="ref" href="/topics/mind">Mind</a> and <a class="ref" href="/topics/nebulosity">Nebulosity</a> with <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>, like in the notion that the physical universe itself is essentially just a nebulous flux, and pattern is this mental overlay of conceptual projection.</p><p id="6UkjDg68i">Of course it's no dramatic discovery that reality itself has patterns. But it seems somehow necessary to point out. Chapman puts it like this:</p><blockquote id="lYwdpgUO_">Pattern is what makes the world interpretable—what makes it make sense. Perceiving pattern is needed for all effective action—whether you are a person or a bug. <a class="cite" href="/articles/pattern-|-meaningness#U9lawvWe0" title="Go to quote">*</a></blockquote><p id="UceV9Uf3j">Here, pattern isn't the interpretation—it's that which makes interpretation possible. It's the real fact of structure that plays out in the universe regardless if any mind is there to interpret it.</p><p id="S3f7oKa5L">Thinking about it like this also seems to afford a better way of thinking about <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue">📙 After Virtue</a>. Yesterday I wrote:</p><p id="YW9vuXd2k">((VUYfEvEU1))</p><p id="zq_vUYNTk">That <a class="ref" href="/topics/grammar">Grammar</a> is not just a product of culture or interpretation; it's grounded in physical, nonhuman <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a> in the landscape, the seasons, biology, etc.</p><p id="nygq02vqP">This way of thinking makes me interested in reading another book of <a class="ref" href="/topics/alasdair-macintyre">Alasdair MacIntyre</a>'s, namely <a class="ref" href="/books/dependent-rational-animals">📙 Dependent Rational Animals</a>, which I believe is his attempt to grapple with <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s views on the relationship between <a class="ref" href="/topics/biology">Biology</a> and <a class="ref" href="/topics/teleology">Teleology</a>.</p><p id="sy2yDDc2X">Judging by this single quote that I had already highlighted from that book, I realize it's also very relevant to my project of understanding how <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> relates to <a class="ref" href="/books/experiences-of-depression">📙 Experiences of Depression</a>.</p><blockquote id="En4lyb4MZ">Consider how both physical and mental disability are afflictions of the body and how therefore habits of mind that express an attitude of denial towards the facts of disability and dependence presuppose either a failure or a refusal to acknowledge adequately the bodily dimensions of our existence. This failure or refusal is perhaps rooted in, is certainly reinforced by the extent to which we conceive of ourselves and imagine ourselves as other than animal, as exempt from the hazardous condition of “mere” animality.  <a class="cite" href="/books/dependent-rational-animals#VmIf5JFPZ" title="Go to quote">*</a></blockquote></div></section></article></html>
