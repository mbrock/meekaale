In my small Swedish hometown, games like <em>Morrowind</em>, <em>Diablo</em>, and <em>Ultima Online</em> were like the fairytales of my adolescence, fantastic worlds of heroism, charm, and <a class="ref" href="/topics/salience">Salience</a>.</p><h3 id="4yY_NoUhg">Horizontal Freedom and Vertical Quest</h3><p id="IjELnpAn7">I see two different aspects of this kind of game that make them so interesting as a lens to look at life.

The primary way of playing "vertically" is to follow the <a class="ref" href="/topics/main-quest">Main Quest</a>. Playing "horizontally" is a more diverse mode: exploring, tinkering with your <a class="ref" href="/topics/equipment">Equipment</a>, fighting critters just to boost your skills, etc.</p><p id="lRI1C9Nsi">I see the <a class="ref" href="/topics/horizontal">Horizontal</a> as <a class="ref" href="/topics/phenomenology">Phenomenology</a> and the <a class="ref" href="/topics/vertical">Vertical</a> as <a class="ref" href="/topics/teleology">Teleology</a>.</p><p id="3dSoctBnq">I think my main philosophical interest is how those two relate to each other.</p><h3 id="pyD80kbpY">The Freedom of Open Worlds</h3><p id="ggkjr5_AV">In adventure games, there's the notion of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/open-world">Open World</a>, which I wrote about a few days ago in ((pTRKbBs9p)). </p><p id="7-DTdgrb7">The main feature of <a class="ref" href="/topics/open-world-games">Open-World Games</a> is that they open up the <a class="ref" href="/topics/horizontal">Horizontal</a> aspect by making the <a class="ref" href="/topics/vertical">Vertical</a> aspect less predetermined.

There should be a sense that, within the rules of the game world, you can do anything at any time while freely moving about the space.
