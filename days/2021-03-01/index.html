In my small Swedish hometown, games like <em>Morrowind</em>, <em>Diablo</em>, and <em>Ultima Online</em> were like the fairytales of my adolescence, fantastic worlds of heroism, charm, and <a class="ref" href="/topics/salience">Salience</a>.</p><h3 id="4yY_NoUhg">Horizontal Freedom and Vertical Quest</h3><p id="IjELnpAn7">I see two different aspects of this kind of game that make them so interesting as a lens to look at life. Maybe we can call them the <a class="ref" href="/topics/horizontal">Horizontal</a> and the <a class="ref" href="/topics/vertical">Vertical</a> aspects. </p><p id="Dzo0uP0MB">The <a class="ref" href="/topics/vertical">Vertical</a> is about <a class="ref" href="/topics/quest">Quest</a>, <a class="ref" href="/topics/plot">Plot</a>, and <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a>, while the <a class="ref" href="/topics/horizontal">Horizontal</a> is about <a class="ref" href="/topics/things">Things</a>, <a class="ref" href="/topics/places">Places</a>, and <a class="ref" href="/topics/characters">Characters</a>.</p><p id="TEBOxSTjw">Gameplay happens in both the horizontal and vertical aspects. The primary way of playing "vertically" is to follow the <a class="ref" href="/topics/main-quest">Main Quest</a>. Playing "horizontally" is a more diverse mode: exploring, tinkering with your <a class="ref" href="/topics/equipment">Equipment</a>, fighting critters just to boost your skills, etc.</p><p id="lRI1C9Nsi">I see the <a class="ref" href="/topics/horizontal">Horizontal</a> as <a class="ref" href="/topics/phenomenology">Phenomenology</a> and the <a class="ref" href="/topics/vertical">Vertical</a> as <a class="ref" href="/topics/teleology">Teleology</a>.</p><p id="3dSoctBnq">I think my main philosophical interest is how those two relate to each other.</p><h3 id="pyD80kbpY">The Freedom of Open Worlds</h3><p id="ggkjr5_AV">In adventure games, there's the notion of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/open-world">Open World</a>, which I wrote about a few days ago in ((pTRKbBs9p)). </p><p id="7-DTdgrb7">The main feature of <a class="ref" href="/topics/open-world-games">Open-World Games</a> is that they open up the <a class="ref" href="/topics/horizontal">Horizontal</a> aspect by making the <a class="ref" href="/topics/vertical">Vertical</a> aspect less predetermined.

There should be a sense that, within the rules of the game world, you can do anything at any time while freely moving about the space.

The paradigm of aesthetic expression is the romantic lover who is immersed in his own passion.
