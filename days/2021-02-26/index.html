I always get disoriented trying to follow those narratives, and in stoner noir the protagonist is also dazed and confused. </p><blockquote id="xxrNYSpj7">The idea of plots ‚Äî complex, puzzling, sometimes illusory ‚Äî ties together the various strands of this story like a good Moroccan rug. <a class="cite" href="/articles/inherent-vice-robert-altman-thomas-pynchon-the-coen-brothers-and-the-evolution-of-stoner-noir#yf-Sp167Z" title="Go to quote">*</a></blockquote><p id="I4KeLhteO">So the film has <a class="ref" href="/topics/plot">Plot</a> itself as an ironic theme. It's hard to remember the actual plot of the film because it's so convoluted, digressive, and random. Like the Dude says:</p><blockquote id="xmbXZh6bF">"This is a very¬†complicated¬†case, Maude. You know, a lotta ins, lotta outs, lotta what-have-you's. And, uh, a lotta strands to keep in my head, man."</blockquote><p id="LKxPsWxW7">But isn't this more lifelike than the neat stories of classic Hollywood movies? I guess it depends. How would you describe the plot of your life?</p><p id="tlQDGSvNg">As Eldritch points out, the word <a class="ref" href="/topics/plot">Plot</a> usually refers to the coherent narrative that a typical screenplay needs, but it's also characteristically used by conspiracy theorists and potheads to refer to an illusory <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a> projected on the world's <a class="ref" href="/topics/nebulosity">Nebulosity</a>.</p><blockquote id="dHOfx743R">In a sense, the idea of a plot has always connected the world of the detective and that of the stoner ‚Äî the good detective story requiring a plot above all else, and the stoner often being subject to the conspiranoid intimation that everything might be some kind of plot. <a class="cite" href="/articles/inherent-vice-robert-altman-thomas-pynchon-the-coen-brothers-and-the-evolution-of-stoner-noir#zZeDoHvX4" title="Go to quote">*</a></blockquote><h3 id="kPSc9JqA6">Narrative in <a class="ref" href="/topics/alasdair-macintyre">Alasdair MacIntyre</a>'s <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue">üìô After Virtue</a></h3><p id="dKYsBl8yn">The <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> nature of human life is maybe even more central to <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue">üìô After Virtue</a> than the very concept of virtues. In a way it seems more like a book of "narrative ethics" than a book of "virtue ethics."</p><p id="aB8PLnOKe">It's a basic rule of screenplays that every line of dialogue should carry the <a class="ref" href="/topics/plot">Plot</a> forward. In drama, <em>acting</em> mostly means <em>talking</em>. But a film narrative is made up of words and actions. In a central paragraph, MacIntyre writes:</p><blockquote id="qrqLNT4F5">Deprive children of stories and you leave them unscripted, anxious stutterers in their actions as in their words. <a class="cite" href="/books/after-virtue#kNkKMyorU" title="Go to quote">*</a></blockquote><p id="VUYfEvEU1">When we act in the world, we are "speaking" within the cultural syntax of intelligible behavior. For a child, hearing stories is a way to learn not just the language but also this <a class="ref" href="/topics/grammar">Grammar</a> of actions. For MacIntyre, that structure is the basic fabric of <a class="ref" href="/topics/ethics">Ethics</a>.</p><blockquote id="1Z52eEG68">I am presenting both conversations in particular then and human actions in general as enacted narratives. <a class="cite" href="/books/after-virtue#vy6c0fKpp" title="Go to quote">*</a></blockquote><p id="GZGZkCOyH">Actions in a plot are not atomic behaviors but parts in larger adventures. Life is like that, but this is sometimes not recognized in philosophy. Ethical theories like utilitarianism tend to focus on isolated actions, having nothing to say about the narrative structures in which they are intelligible.</p><blockquote id="G-hPjEXrO">That particular actions derive their character as parts of larger wholes is a point of view alien to our dominant ways of thinking and yet one which it is necessary at least to consider if we are to begin to understand how a life may be more than a sequence of individual actions and episodes. <a class="cite" href="/books/after-virtue#gW9ihoJIK" title="Go to quote">*</a></blockquote><p id="fSy4k5guA">The critical argument of <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue">üìô After Virtue</a> is that we now generally suffer from a disrupted ability to make sense of our lives as coherent stories within larger common stories. In some way <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> has lost the plot. </p><p id="Ud7aMddsg">We are in what <a class="ref" href="/topics/david-chapman">David Chapman</a> calls the <a class="ref" href="/topics/atomized-mode">Atomized Mode</a>:</p><blockquote id="tXKpciL7R">Meanings do not hang together. They are delivered as bite-sized morsels in a jumbled stream, like sushi flowing past on a conveyer belt, or brilliant shards of colored glass in a kaleidoscope. Or‚Äîto use the thing itself as a metaphor for itself‚Äîlike Twitter. <a class="cite" href="/articles/how-meaning-fell-apart-|-meaningness#jX2Vf0O8T" title="Go to quote">*</a></blockquote><p id="zdWWRsXxZ">I'm out of time for today, but I'd like to expand on these themes in the future. What I managed to write about <em>After Virtue</em> here today feels very fragmentary. I still have a very undudelike approach to writing.</p></div></section><section class="mt-2"><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/idea">Idea</a></h3><div><p><a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-26">February 26th, 2021</a></p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/inherent-vice-robert-altman-thomas-pynchon-the-coen-brothers-and-the-evolution-of-stoner-noir">Inherent Vice: Robert Altman, Thomas Pynchon, the Coen Brothers, and the Evolution of Stoner Noir.</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-26">February 26th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/axiology-morality-law">üì∞ Axiology, Morality, Law</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-26">February 26th, 2021</a>.</p><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-26">February 26th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/how-meaning-fell-apart-|-meaningness">üì∞ How Meaning Fell Apart | Meaningness</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-26">February 26th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/how-to-get-the-most-from-write-of-passage">üì∞ How to Get the Most From Write of Passage</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-26">February 26th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/roam-free-a-history-of-open-world-gaming">üì∞ Roam Free: A History of Open-World Gaming</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-26">February 26th, 2021</a>.</p><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-26">February 26th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/the-big-lebowski---wikiquote">üì∞ The Big Lebowski - Wikiquote</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-26">February 26th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/i-wrote-down-some-thou-dot-dot-dot">üìù I Wrote Down Some Thou...</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-26">February 26th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
