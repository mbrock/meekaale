If you want to get all reductive, think of it as comparing the values of world-states. A world-state where everybody is happy seems better than a world-state where everybody is sad. A world-state with lots of beautiful art is better than a world-state containing only featureless concrete cubes. Maybe some people think a world-state full of people living in harmony with nature is better than a world-state full of gleaming domed cities, and other people believe the opposite; when they debate the point, they’re debating axiology.</blockquote><blockquote id="Ve5f1S2XL"><a class="ref" href="/topics/morality">Morality</a> is the study of what the right thing to do is. If someone says “don’t murder”, they’re making a moral commandment. If someone says “Pirating music is wrong”, they’re making a moral claim. Maybe some people believe you should pull the lever on the trolley problem, and other people believe you shouldn’t; when they debate the point, they’re debating morality.</blockquote><blockquote id="p5gCAauqN">These concepts stay separate because they each make different compromises between goodness, implementation, and coordination.</blockquote><blockquote id="S0-Z0PZWu">At least from a rule-utilitarianesque perspective, morality is an attempt to triage the infinite demands of axiology, in order to make them implementable by specific people living in specific communities.</blockquote><blockquote id="cNr-jOVTj">Law is an attempt to formalize the complicated demands of morality, in order to make them implementable by a state with police officers and law courts.</blockquote><blockquote id="2bnwsOVda">Most “moral dilemmas” are philosophers trying to create perverse situations where axiology and morality give opposite answers.</blockquote><blockquote id="cp67a_Eoi">With this framework, we can propose a clearer answer to the moral offsetting problem: you can offset axiology, but not morality.</blockquote></div><h3 id="AEmJ8S6rt">Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-26">February 26th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote id="UYzLQJCxX">The problem with murder isn’t just that it creates a world in which one extra person is dead.

But everyone – you, me, Amanda Askell, society – seems to want a system that tells us to offset carbon but not murder, and when we find such a system I think it’s worth taking it seriously.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
