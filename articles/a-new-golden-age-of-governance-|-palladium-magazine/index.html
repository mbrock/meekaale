But you cannot construct such a thing by fiat or in response to need. A faithless technocratic prescription of faith fails to achieve it. Life comes only from life. If we have only enough life left to lament that we are dying, then we should hurry up and die to make way for the coming world.</blockquote><blockquote id="MJ0_rpLHR">Our real vital potential is concentrated primarily in small seeds‚Äîindependent institutions and networks that have the potential to grow with proper cultivation. What is lacking is only the conviction that now is the time for these seeds of new growth to wax their ambitions and take root in the rotting nurse log of our society.</blockquote><blockquote id="R1msMvw7e">Governments and societies, like all living adaptive systems, are strongest when they exert themselves towards great goals beyond themselves.</blockquote><blockquote id="SJVAsV_e_">Huge segments of our economy have become essentially fake.</blockquote><blockquote id="0xh2SpRMD">The rhetoric of the ‚Äúdeveloped economy‚Äù rings false alongside potholed and crumbling infrastructure, food and transit deserts, empty industrial buildings, chronic underemployment, and shortage of quality goods. And those are just the problems we can see, leaving out the great advances we can still imagine. We are not anywhere near a fully developed society‚Äîwe are mostly not even developing.</blockquote><blockquote id="IRb94x4Ps">Our environmental crisis is a control problem, not just a question of reducing our impact through the obvious waste reduction, recycling, and decarbonization; we need to be able to actively steer our environment towards desirable states.</blockquote><blockquote id="Wu753H5YJ">We need to not just preserve, but accelerate and supplement, the health of our ecosystems. This means everything from climate geo-engineering, to wild ecosystem fertilization, green cities, and urban forests, measures improving soil health and biodiversity, desert greening, technological carbon capture, genetically engineered plastic-composting bugs, regenerative agriculture, and general ecosystem restoration. In short: we need to terraform Earth.</blockquote><blockquote id="d5Yjv2rvX">We can and should tackle the issue head-on with a great vision of environmental progress: we should master our environmental impact to cultivate a fully sustainable garden planet of unprecedented biological and industrial productivity.</blockquote><blockquote id="5NFk3noSn">At its early stage, any new paradigm will be represented by a network of seed institutions. Like biological seeds, what matters with these seed institutions is not their initial scale. Rather, what matters is that they are operating on and developing a genuinely better paradigm, and that they can survive and grow as the society around them falters and even becomes hostile to growth.</blockquote><blockquote id="OVq0gQ_6u">Our society is facing a hard winter. But there is no need for resignation. Autumn is simply the time to let go, pull back the leaves, and plant the seeds of new growth that will come in spring. If we put the effort in now to lay the groundwork of a new and better paradigm, it can be a glorious spring indeed.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
