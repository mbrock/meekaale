If I learned that I was about to die, it is to this preciousness that my mind would turn.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>To me, the idea that life is, or can be, “good” doesn’t seem to cover it. “Good” feels too thin and controlled; too compared. The thing I’m talking about feels related to recognizing goodness, but in a way that moves past appraisal or assessment, towards something more like devotion, loyalty, reverence, awe.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>I don’t have kids. But if I did, I imagine that showing them this party would be one of the joys. Saying to them: “Here, look, this is the world. These are trees, these are stars, this is what we have learned so far, this is what we don’t know, this is where it all might be going. You’re a part of this now. Welcome.”</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section></article></html>
