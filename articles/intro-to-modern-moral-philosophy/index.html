Call these moral theories ‚Äúconsequentialist.‚Äù A consequentialist ethics fails to produce moral absolutes. Insofar as we care about these absolutes, we should abandon consequentialist moral theories.</blockquote><blockquote>Deontology needs a God figure to ground the morally obligatory sense of the word ought. If we want to talk about moral absolutes without a God figure, then one should look to Aristotle. In Aristotle‚Äôs virtue ethics, illicit action is that which contradicts the set of virtues, where Aristotle saw no need to talk about a God.</blockquote><blockquote>But, before we can do this, one needs a requisite philosophy of psychology to describe human nature, action, what a virtue is, and human flourishing. Once these are in place, one could formulate a virtue ethics around the ordinary sense of ought, generate absolutes, and not have to deal with a God figure.</blockquote><blockquote>When right action concerns consequences, so too does praise and blame. I.e. bad consequences are worthy of blame, good ones are worthy of blame. So, am I worthy of blame when my action produces ill consequences? It seems that consequentialists are willing to admit one isn‚Äôt worthy of blame if one did not foresee these consequences.</blockquote><blockquote>Deontological theories have a linguistic similarity to divine law conceptions of ethics, the difference being the objective grounding in divine law is a God figure who promulgates the law.</blockquote><blockquote>Deontological ethics without a God figure has no leg to stand on.</blockquote><blockquote>There is still a line for us to take in the search for a secular, prohibition-based system of ethics. There is hope in replacing the objective grounding of God with some form of existing norms.</blockquote><blockquote>Just as man has a certain number of teeth, he has a certain set of virtues. So, while this man might not have that many teeth, man considered as a logical object, not a biological one, sets a standard of normativity. By having knowledge of man in this way, we have the requisite grounding for a new system of ethics.</blockquote><blockquote>In order to get to the place where we can say a man ought to be virtuous, or, an unjust man is a bad man, we need to take a step back from ethics and look to the philosophy of psychology.</blockquote><blockquote>Until we have some requisite concepts in place, our <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> can‚Äôt get off the ground. Among these concepts are a description of human nature, human action, what a virtue is, and human flourishing.</blockquote><blockquote>Anscombe begins this project in Intention, what she considers a book containing no ethics, and you can see similar attempts at filling this philosophical gap in Philippa Foot‚Äôs Natural Goodness or Michael Thompson‚Äôs Life and Action.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
