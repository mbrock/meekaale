There is nothing underneath objects. Or, better, there is not even nothing underneath them. There is no such thing as space independent of objects (happily contemporary physics agrees). What is called Universe is a large object that contains objects such as black holes and racing pigeons. Likewise there is no such thing as an environment: wherever we look for it, we find all kinds of objectsâ€”biomes, ecosystems, hedges, gutters and human flesh. In a similar sense, there is no such thing as Nature.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section></article></html>
