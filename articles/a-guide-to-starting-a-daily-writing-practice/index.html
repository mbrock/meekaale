By getting to regularly experience writing as relatively easy, youâ€™ll start to drain some of that anxiety.</blockquote><blockquote>By writing daily youâ€™ll start to notice themes across your writing, and you can begin to draw them out, connecting up your knowledge and thoughts better.</blockquote><blockquote>You should avoid any nontrivial activation energy for getting started and just start. Pick wherever to write is the lowest effort for you to do so, donâ€™t try to do anything complicated to get set up.</blockquote><blockquote>My favourite prompt is to find some interesting passage of writing, copy it out, and add commentary.</blockquote></div></section><section class="mt-2"><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/2021-02-22">February 22nd, 2021</a></h3><div><p>Inspired by <a class="ref" href="/topics/at-drmaciver">@DRMacIver</a>'s text <a class="ref" href="/articles/a-guide-to-starting-a-daily-writing-practice">ðŸ“° A Guide to Starting a Daily Writing Practice</a>, I'm launching this <a class="ref" href="/topics/daily-public-notebook">Daily Public Notebook</a> as a Roam graph, aiming to write something here almost every day.</p><p>And so I've already been privately doing what <a class="ref" href="/articles/a-guide-to-starting-a-daily-writing-practice">ðŸ“° A Guide to Starting a Daily Writing Practice</a> recommends:</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
