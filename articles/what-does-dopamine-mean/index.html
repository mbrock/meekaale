By contrast, learning â€˜looks backwardsâ€™ at states and actions in the recent past and updates their values.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>I propose an updated model, based on three key facts: (i) dopamine release from terminals does not arise simply from dopamine cell firing, but can also be locally controlled; (ii) dopamine affects both synaptic plasticity and excitability of target cells, with distinct consequences for learning and performance respectively; and (iii) dopamine effects on plasticity can be switched on or off by nearby circuit elements. Together, these features may allow brain circuits to toggle between two distinct dopamine messages, for learning and motivation respectively.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section></article></html>
