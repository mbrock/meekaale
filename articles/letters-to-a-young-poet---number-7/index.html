And what can happen then? What can life do with this heap of half-broken things that they call their communion and that they would like to call their happiness, if that were possible, and their future? And so each of them loses himself for the sake of the other person, and loses the other, and many others who still wanted to come.</blockquote><blockquote id="YOzENVO_x">This advance (at first very much against the will of the outdistanced men) will transform the <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> experience, which is now filled with error, will change it from the ground up, and reshape it into a relationship that is meant to be between one human being and another, no longer one that flows from man to woman. And this more human <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> (which will fulfill itself with infinite consideration and gentleness, and kindness and clarity in binding and releasing) will resemble what we are now preparing painfully and with great struggle: the <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> that consists in this: that two solitudes protect and border and greet each other.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
