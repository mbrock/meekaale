Yet, in the writings of the saints,   we find an entirely different reality; that it is precisely suffering that strengthens us, humbles us, and forges us into saints. But more than this, we discover that suffering is of such inestimable redemptive worth, that nothing equals it in heaven or on earth. As Our Lord told Saint Faustina; "If the angels were capable of envy, they would envy us for two things: one is the receiving of Holy Communion, and the other is suffering."</blockquote><blockquote id="cmvHkydtU">Christianity is the religion of radical love; love in its highest form; not a warm fuzzy feeling, but a manly love; a love that is willing to be trampled upon, to be dragged face-down in the dust so others can be saved.  This kind of Love entered our world as a baby, and walked this earth long ago, so mankind could learn how to live in response. And the  only true and proper response to love, is love.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
