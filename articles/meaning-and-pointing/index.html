In a sense, if our eyes are open, we are always pointing (at something) to any observer who cares to look.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The word “meaning” in English is itself a polyseme, a word with multiple meanings. In one sense, “meaning” refers to the referent of a word, its dictionary meaning or a particular contextual sense. In a broader sense, “meaning” refers to value, purpose, and more cosmic significance (as in “the meaning of life”).</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>While not a linguistic universal, it is very common in other languages for the word for semantic, dictionary “meaning” to also be used to indicate a deeper sense of purpose or significance.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>“Meaning” in the sense of “meaning of life” carries with it from the semantic sense of “meaning” the expectation of a pointing relationship. What is the purpose of life, or love, or getting up in the morning? What does it signify?</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Human cognition is characterized by asking “why?” – explicitly as a child, internally as an adult.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Baumeister divides purposes into two types: goals and fulfillments. Goals are short-term future plans that are likely to actually be achieved; once a goal is completed, a new one must be found. Fulfillments, on the other hand, are fantasies about an idealized far future.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>If, as I have tried to motivate above, meaning is pointing, then in order to perform the essential human functions of experiencing meaning and feeling at <a class="ref" href="/topics/home">Home</a> in the world – in order not to get lost in derealization or depersonalization – we must navigate complexity using comfortable mental maps that point to our shared social world of information.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Mental maps for geographic navigation may help us feel at <a class="ref" href="/topics/home">Home</a>, creating a “meaningful” pointing relationship between what is in our minds and the world around us, but most of our time is spent not in geographic space, but in the information spaces created by language, technology, and culture. And we must have mental maps for these as well.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section></article></html>
