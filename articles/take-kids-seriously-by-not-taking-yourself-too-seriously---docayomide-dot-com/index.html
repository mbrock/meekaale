He stayed with us off and on, while we were growing up, sometimes for months at a time. He gave us time and attention and treated my brothers and I like we were a big deal to him. Like how he acted whenever he was back from uni. Where other adults in my life then would exclaim, “Look how much you’ve grown!” I still remember how he’d look at us and say softly, “Man, I missed you guys.” I still remember how that always made me feel warm inside.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
