Nor does he want weak Christians, Christians who have no will of their own, “remote-controlled” Christians incapable of creativity, who always seek to connect with the will of someone else and are not free. Jesus wants us free. And where is this freedom created? It is created in dialogue with God in the person’s own conscience. If a Christian is unable to speak with God, if he cannot hear God in his own conscience, he is not free, he is not free.</blockquote><blockquote id="hK5AMSXPy">The conscience is the interior place for listening to the truth, to goodness, for listening to God; it is the inner place of my relationship with him, the One who speaks to my heart and helps me to discern, to understand the way I must take and, once the decision is made, to go forward, to stay faithful.</blockquote></div></section><section class="references"><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/2021-03-05">March 5th, 2021</a></h3><div><p>From Pope Francis, <a class="ref" href="/articles/angelus-30-june-2013">📰 Angelus, 30 June 2013</a>:</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
