Much later, my mother revealed she thought throughout my childhood that I was some kind of genius. In fact I am not, but I had a similar illusion: my childhood was characterized, above all, by the subjective certainty of being a prodigy at something, but not yet having found the ‘thing’.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><h3>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-15th-2021">March 15th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote>My son was formula fed; he slept on his stomach, alone, in a crib, by way of “cry it out”; he was in diapers till he was nearly 4; I let him eat what he wanted and did not try to educate his tastes (and for a few months one of the things he ate was: sand); he was in daycare from a young age, when he was sick I mostly ignored it. He was born believing he was a grownup and I did not correct this—once he was a fluent speaker (18 months), every decision was made by argument and persuasion. I did, however, make use of his epistemic vulnerabilities so as to lie to him about the existence of magical powers/objects/creatures. (I figured he needed some kind of childhood.) We both preferred the playgrounds when there was no one else there, so we went in the early mornings, I would read while he played with toys that people left there.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>If we assume, in the theory of rationality, that all practical rationality boils down to the rationality of decision making; in moral psychology, that all reasons are internal reasons; in the theory of moral responsibility, that there is no such thing as self-creation—then we are depriving ourselves of the conceptual apparatus required for recognizing the fact that people exercise agency in learning to have different values than the ones they have.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The book argues that aspiration comes into view when we acknowledge the possibility of proleptic rationality (the rationality of activities that are essentially extended over time); intrinsic conflict (deliberative questions that are not only undecidable but unposeable from the point of view of the agent); and teleological normative guidance (“creating oneself” by subjecting oneself to the governance of the person one will be).</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>How’d you meet your current husband?

He was a student in a grad seminar I taught on Aristotle’s ethics. He came to office hours every week, our discussions ranged outside the ethics but not outside of Aristotle. (One of our meetings, as I recall, was entirely devoted to Metaphysics Iota). During the final office hours session of the quarter, he told me he was in love with me. I immediately realized the same was true of me, although we had never discussed anything but Aristotle up to that point. We have since, but Aristotle does tend to predominate.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section></article></html>
