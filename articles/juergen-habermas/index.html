postwar Germany. The Nuremberg Trials were a key formative moment that
brought home to him the depth of Germany's moral and political
failure under National Socialism. This experience was later reinforced
when, as a graduate student interested in Heidegger's
existentialism, he read the latter's reissued Introduction to
Metaphysics, in which Heidegger had retained (or more accurately,
reintroduced) an allusion to the “inner truth and
greatness” of National Socialism (Heidegger 1959, 199). When
Habermas (1953) publicly called for an explanation from Heidegger, the
latter's silence confirmed Habermas's conviction that the
German philosophical tradition had failed in its moment of reckoning,
providing intellectuals with the resources neither to understand nor to
criticize National Socialism.</blockquote><blockquote>In
his description of the salons we clearly see his interest in a
communicative ideal that later would provide the core normative
standard for his moral-political theory: the idea of inclusive critical
discussion, free of social and economic pressures, in which
interlocutors treat each other as equals in a cooperative attempt to
reach an understanding on matters of common concern.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
