The ego is the center of conscious identity, whereas the Self is the center of the total personalityâ€”including consciousness, the unconscious, and the ego. The Self is both the whole and the center. While the ego is a self-contained little circle off the center contained within the whole, the Self can be understood as the greater circle.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>"If the Self could be wholly experienced, it would be a limited experience, whereas in reality its experience is unlimited and endless.... If I were one with the Self I would have knowledge of everything, I would speak Sanskrit, read cuneiform script, know the events that took place in pre-history be acquainted with the life of other planets, etc."</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section></article></html>
