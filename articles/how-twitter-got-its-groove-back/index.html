Twitter should be more experimental with profiles since they're hidden away from the core product experience, letting people personalize, set up storefronts, create spaces to hang out, and build a more direct connection with friends and followers.</blockquote><blockquote id="YadpzJa0K">With the launch of Twitter Spaces and the acquisition of Revue, Twitter is building a Creator ecosystem in which it keeps some of the value it creates. It's competing with two hot, a16z-backed startups, Clubhouse and Substack, to own the conversation and the associated monetization opportunities. I think it will win the newsletter wars, which will give it a leg up in the audio wars.</blockquote><blockquote id="U1z6cfAbX">As Twitter builds out more ways for Creators and their followers to engage and exchange value, I expect it to finally turn profiles, "the most undervalued real estate on the internet," into everyone's own virtual home and store.</blockquote><blockquote id="Fe8vT2AFW">And as for Jack? Whether accidentally or through an ultra-attuned third eye and a Zen-like ability to withstand half a decade's worth of criticism, he's put Twitter in a surprisingly strong strategic position. It's the most credible front page and at-scale monetization engine for Creators right when the Creator Economy is taking off. Its ad product is making a comeback. Because it didn't scare smart users away like Facebook has, it is where the world's conversation happens. It has one of the most valuable data firehoses in the world. And if Twitter needs lightweight storefronts and a payments engine for this to really achieve liftoff, Jack knows a guy.</blockquote><blockquote id="bBrcyJYEd">That's another advantage Twitter has: despite, or because of, its history of slow product development and poorly-integrated acquisitions, Twitter is the only major tech company that I could see building or acquiring idea-based Creator tools and integrating them into a holistic ecosystem. Facebook also announced that it's planning to launch a newsletter product, but I can't imagine writing a newsletter on Facebook. My social graph doesn't map nearly as well to readers as Twitter's interest graph.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
