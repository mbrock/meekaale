It was only by venturing out in public that even the master could enjoy a measure of freedom and agency. At <a class="ref" href="/topics/home">Home</a>, there was a defined role with duties for everyone. And if you never really left the domestic sphere, you were basically never really free.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
