Rather, it is a kind of violent intervention by which individuals are transformed against their will from narrow-minded and weak-willed subjects, fearfully attached to their old opinions, into more strong-minded and dynamic ones capable of considering a range of views.</blockquote><blockquote id="0ppyn3A-l">For Mill, politics is the art of producing citizens with certain desirable cognitive capacities and emotional qualities.</blockquote><blockquote id="rjqeiudZC">Mill’s ideal citizen is full of energy and ambition, insistent on developing their own opinions and acting according to their own moral standards.</blockquote><blockquote id="yUlDlpnq6">These qualities of mind are crucial, Mill claimed, not only to personal flourishing but to the power of the state.</blockquote><blockquote id="TCAZUkQ9s">Feelings and desires, he insisted, are “another name for energy,” and the task of politics is to incite and harness individual energy for social purposes—not to drain that energy away with clichéd moralisms and socially obligatory routines.</blockquote><blockquote id="AYiSEXuO_">Those with good characters and energy must be helped to become still more virtuous, and even heroic.</blockquote><blockquote id="SZErkINAv">Liberalism, from this point of view, is a series of techniques for restraining bad characters, rewarding good ones, creating productive competition, and teaching citizens how they can be both most authentically individual and usefully social.</blockquote><blockquote id="W6jZaNAL_">Few of Mill’s modern commentators in the West have caught the importance of this point. Perhaps the sharpest observer to have done so is the American philosopher Elijah Millgram.</blockquote><blockquote id="ENL7HT1C1">Liberalism, with its focus on restraints on the state’s interference in people’s private lives, was not as such a means of setting individuals free from social control. Rather, it allowed them to contribute to social and economic progress through the removal of harmful restraints and the transformation of individuals into “strong-willed agents.”</blockquote><blockquote id="9_OEQjr_n">Their energies, released from convention and censorship, would also ultimately contribute to the power of the very state from which they had only seemed to be emancipated.</blockquote><blockquote id="_T8-d3WVh">Developing this internal ethical core of agency is the “True Way.” From this perspective, liberalism is not a refusal to legislate morality, but precisely an effort to compel citizens to pursue a vision of the good, understood as a certain ideal of character.</blockquote><blockquote id="-zAms4eYl">The liberalism of the modern West no longer seems to produce the kind of dynamic, independent-minded agents that Mill and Yan expected it to. Indeed, Westerners—and especially young elites in prestigious Western universities—seem increasingly conformist and censorious.</blockquote><blockquote id="mJTrkuMR0">If Mill and Yan are right, such censorious personalities are not capable of competently managing institutions and ensuring social and economic progress in a world full of rival states.</blockquote><blockquote id="wdrVF2Rib">Even if the West maintains a firmly liberal self-conception through our coming crisis, it can and should be a liberalism of heroic action unleashed from small-minded censorship and procedural restraint, rather than the inertia that has come to characterize our society, as it did imperial China in its decline.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
