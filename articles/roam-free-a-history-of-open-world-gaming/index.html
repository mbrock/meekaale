These games provide a list of (predominantly violent) verbs that's minuscule in comparison to the options you would face in identical real-life situations. Yet, we can't get enough of them.</blockquote><blockquote id="wub3xZeyz">But to really classify a game as open world, it's got to be about freedom. There should be a sense that, within the rules of the game world, you can do anything at any time while freely moving about the space. It's essential for true open-world games to offer the freedom to decide when to do things, which by extension means a freedom to do things other than moving on to the next main story beat.</blockquote><blockquote id="TDd7r9Y1W">The growing seriousness of the Rockstar model of open worlds presented an opportunity to capture a new niche, a kind of play for play's sake, a city- or state-scale sandbox filled with toysâ€”not verisimilitude or attempted emotional storytellingâ€”and a flimsy excuse to cause chaos.</blockquote></div><h3 id="ZPZ_KuUsl">Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-02-26">February 26th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote id="TXYvd00xB">As this busy, mission and event-dense style of open world grows more dominant as a design modality, it'll be increasingly important for games like Crackdown, Elite Dangerous, and the Just Cause series to remind us of the true promise of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/open-world">Open World</a>: that we could be free, to do whatever we want, at any time, in any way, and to play with our virtual worlds in the same imaginative, limitless way a child plays with the real one.</blockquote></div></section><section class="mt-2"><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/2021-03-01">March 1st, 2021</a></h3><div><p>In the article <a class="ref" href="/articles/roam-free-a-history-of-open-world-gaming">ðŸ“° Roam Free: A History of Open-World Gaming</a>, we read:</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
