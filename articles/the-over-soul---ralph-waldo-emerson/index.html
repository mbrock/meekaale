What is the ground of this uneasiness of ours; of this old discontent?</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Man is a stream whose source is hidden. Our being is descending into us from we know not whence.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>As with events, so is it with thoughts. When I watch that flowing river, which, out of regions I see not, pours for a season its streams into me, I see that I am a pensioner; not a cause, but a surprised spectator of this ethereal water; that I desire and look up, and put myself in the attitude of reception, but from some alien energy the visions come.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><h3>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-9th-2021">March 9th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote>The weakness of the will begins, when the individual would be something of himself. All reform aims, in some one particular, to let the soul have its way through us; in other words, to engage us to obey.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The landscape, the figures, Boston, London, are facts as fugitive as any institution past, or any whiff of mist or smoke, and so is society, and so is the world. The soul looketh steadily forwards, creating a world before her, leaving worlds behind her. She has no dates, nor rites, nor persons, nor specialties, nor men. The soul knows only the soul; the web of events is the flowing robe in which she is clothed.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>To the well-born child, all the virtues are natural, and not painfully acquired. Speak to his heart, and the man becomes suddenly virtuous.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Those who are capable of humility, of justice, of love, of aspiration, stand already on a platform that commands the sciences and arts, speech and poetry, action and grace. For whoso dwells in this moral beatitude already anticipates those special powers which men prize so highly.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section></article></html>
