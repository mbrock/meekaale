The result is a strategy for getting along and getting ahead ‚Äî a strategy we call "personality."</blockquote><blockquote id="z9fqcFLx1">In order to understand how personality develops, we first need to understand its purpose ‚Äî what it's developing towards.</blockquote><blockquote id="RLXOBUgNf">How your body turns out isn't fully determined by its genes, but rather emerges from the interaction between genes and environment.</blockquote><blockquote id="AEqVPLQBI">Everything about yourself that you might care about only makes sense relative to the other features of the environment.</blockquote><blockquote id="nJlB0ZgwY">Notice how this cleaves 'nature' and 'nurture' at an oblique angle, rather than right down the middle. It's not a simple matter of nature providing raw materials and nurture shaping them into a unique personality. Rather, nature and nurture conspire (during biological development) to produce a prototype, and the prototype then negotiates with the environment (during socialization) to produce the final result.</blockquote><blockquote id="rECHe0QGi">And although the environment plays a pivotal role in socialization, it's misleading to call it 'nurture', since that word implies an intentional, helpful relationship (as of a mother toward her child). Instead, the relationship between child and environment is antagonistic.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
