But often they didnâ€™t, and then Iâ€™d be disappointed and have to adjust the narrative to account for the setback, hoping that the story would get back on course.</blockquote><blockquote id="R-dRzbT3d">This narrative thinking was damaging in a way I didnâ€™t realize: I was more engaged with the narrative than I was with my actual life. I lived half in reality, half in my head, and I was crushed when real life didnâ€™t line up with the story in my head.</blockquote><blockquote id="ZB7tqAnr4">Most people believe that if we let go of narrative we canâ€™t move forward in our lives. But Singer thinks we donâ€™t need a story: we can progress effectively just by doing the thing that seems most compelling at every point. Instead of acting in accordance to your narrative preferences, you simply do the thing thatâ€™s tugging you forward.</blockquote><blockquote id="hSaifJ2Ip">Most of us immediately subject pure experience to narrative processing, but you donâ€™t need to do that. You can choose to experience every event through the lens of narrative, or you can choose to reject it and live a life thatâ€™s not organized or confined by mental storiesâ€”to live an unstoried life.</blockquote><blockquote id="Tu9fOInBJ">The experience of consciousness radically differs depending on how you approach it. You could, if you wanted, experience your life as a wide-open sea of experience instead of a narrow river leading to one destination. What if the way to live a better story was to stop narrativizing constantly?</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
