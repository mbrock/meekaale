You know, a lotta ins, lotta outs, lotta what-have-you's. And, uh, lotta strands to keep in my head, man. Lotta strands in old Duder's head. Luckily I'm adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my <a class="ref" href="/topics/mind">Mind</a>, you know, limber.</blockquote><blockquote>..Fuck me. I mean, say what you want about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it's an ethos.</blockquote><blockquote>Walter Sobchak: Were you listening to The Dude's story?
Donny: I was bowling.
Walter Sobchak: So you have no frame of reference here, Donny. You're like a child who wanders into the middle of a movie and wants to know -
The Dude: Walter, Walter, what's the point, man?
Walter Sobchak: There's no reason - Here's my point, Dude. There's no fucking reason why these two -
Donny: Yeah, Walter, what's your point?
Walter Sobchak: Huh?
The Dude: Walter, what is the poin-? Look, we all know who is at fault here - what the fuck are you talking about?
Walter Sobchak: Huh? No, what the fuck are you â€¦ ! I'm not â€¦ we're talking about unchecked aggression here, Dude.
Donny: What the fuck is he talking about?
The Dude: My rug.

There are rules.</blockquote><blockquote>Walter Sobchak: (shouting) Has the whole world gone CRAZY?! [stands up] AM I THE ONLY ONE AROUND HERE WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT THE RULES?! MARK IT ZERO!</blockquote><blockquote>Coen brothers' The Big Lebowski is a genial, shambling comedy about a human train wreck, and should come with a warning like the one Mark Twain attached to Huckleberry Finn: "Persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot."</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
