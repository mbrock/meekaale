For Hegel, by contrast, the actual meaning of the incarnation is that any form of the divine must be born historically and must be vulnerable to death. The life-defining norms to which we hold ourselves (God) can exist only by being embodied in our material practices as individual social actors (Christ), who can live on only through the institutional forms of recognition that we share (the Holy Spirit).</blockquote><blockquote id="tNZBFnZ6r">On Hegel’s account, the self-understanding of religious believers is thus at odds with their own practical activity. The actual object of devotion is the community itself, which means that the object of faith is inseparable from the historical practice of faith. The Christian Trinity, for example, is not an independently existing reality but a pictorial representation of the structure of the community of believers. “God” is a name for the self-legislated communal norms (the principles to which the congregation holds itself); “Christ” is a name for the social actors who sustain the norms through their embodied practices; and “the Holy Spirit” is a name for the institutional relations of the Church through which the norms are actualized.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
