Explicitly invoking ‚Äúthe state‚Äù by name is considered poor taste, and raison d‚Äô√âtat‚Äîthe idea that political decision-making should be guided by the higher ends and interests of the state‚Äîis only paid lip service at best.</blockquote><blockquote id="c1QWCFMNB">The state must take great care never to appear as an actor with ends all its own.</blockquote><blockquote id="h0IALEWYi">The state as such, considered as the self-aware subject of its own proper ends and interests, and the author of its own acts, figures in political discourse today only as a pejorative.</blockquote></div><h3 id="Gl6Vvvy0L">Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-15">March 15th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote id="fhx9iOE7K">But social order does not magically emanate in a passive and deterministic process from metaphysical pure reason, nor from the unthinking properties of brute physical matter, and neither is it an unintended consequence of divergent self-seeking desires and interests. It is the product of consciousness, will, and active effort.</blockquote><blockquote id="8ACwxO5qy">This collective actor is sociologically analogous to the biological organism: a self-reproducing whole that is greater than the sum of its parts, and capable of purposive action oriented towards its own existential preservation</blockquote><blockquote id="NSU7CsqrI">The modern state is a res publica or commonwealth: a legal corporation created by its members to advance the purposes and administer the goods and affairs they share in common on their behalf.</blockquote><blockquote id="yGbozlRTr">Through this collective personification and embodiment, individual-level actors can come to consciousness of their unity in their shared identity as citizens of the same nation-state, and acquire the social solidarity that the likes of religion, kinship, and local allegiances can no longer provide by themselves in highly urbanized, diverse, and mobile societies.</blockquote><blockquote id="AlijrMZfN">Consciousness on the part of citizens with respect to the nature and ends of the state‚Äîwhat needs to be done in order to keep the ship of state afloat, what the role and duties of public officers are, etc.‚Äîis thus exactly analogous to psychological self-awareness in the natural person: the master regulatory and coordinating principle of behavioral functions that formulates conscious ends, selects appropriate means, and then directs the whole organism towards the attainment of what it needs for self-preservation.</blockquote><blockquote id="WEnyRiKx3">The degradation of state-oriented consciousness has exactly the same consequences for state and society as those of dementia for the biological organism, namely functional disintegration, and a consecutive level of impairment ranging from the sub-optimal to the fatal.</blockquote><blockquote id="5qbOqH3nz">Most Western nations sit on an enormous apparatus of power upon which the entirety of the nation‚Äôs affairs depends. But it dares not speak its name, and nobody really seems to know just what to do with it.</blockquote><blockquote id="2yw8q9J_y">The dementia of the state is presently making itself felt in the unfolding crisis of civic unity known as tribalism.</blockquote><blockquote id="UYqKiYBF_">The preservation of the state as a goal of political life‚Äîone both able to act beyond factions and to reconcile them‚Äîhas been blotted out of public consciousness, replaced by community activism and party politics.</blockquote><blockquote id="WeNM0AR-X">The activist is a counter-citizen who sees the state not as an end, but as an instrumental means to service the cause, in a complete inversion of the historical sense of the idea of public spirit.</blockquote><blockquote id="jbns0yP3-">Ethical action in politics based on an honor system with an expectation of reciprocal fair play makes no sense outside of a self-consciously statist frame of reference, in which an opponent is also a fellow member of the state and seeker of its good.</blockquote><blockquote id="WPPEijakU">In this respect, the real-life state of nature that has obtained within the state, and under its legal monopoly on violence, is potentially much more threatening than anything in Hobbes‚Äô speculative musings.</blockquote><blockquote id="6jcqvhJDW">The state must become an explicit and irreducible category of analysis and a sociological variable in its own right, alongside the commonplace likes of class, nation, party, race, etc. Instead of taking the state for granted as an immutable fact of life, naively failing to notice or pretending not to notice it, or uncritically accepting ideological strawman attacks against the state as received knowledge, we ought to consciously reflect on it.</blockquote><blockquote id="lrhs9GlL-">We should strive to discard the euphemisms through which we force the state to think and speak in ideological languages not made for it. If the state has a strategic interest in projecting power abroad somewhere, we should call things by their proper names instead of saying and pretending‚Äîor actually believing‚Äîthat we are promoting freedom and democracy, or some other supposedly higher interest.</blockquote><blockquote id="6cmdfBECM">Statecraft, as a highly specialized and technically complicated enterprise, should be accorded at least the same type of deference and the same space of independent action that we accord to STEM and other specialized technical fields of endeavor.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
