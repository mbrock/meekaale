Explicitly invoking “the state” by name is considered poor taste, and raison d’État—the idea that political decision-making should be guided by the higher ends and interests of the state—is only paid lip service at best.</blockquote><blockquote>The state must take great care never to appear as an actor with ends all its own.</blockquote><blockquote>The state as such, considered as the self-aware subject of its own proper ends and interests, and the author of its own acts, figures in political discourse today only as a pejorative.</blockquote></div><h3>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-15">March 15th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote>But social order does not magically emanate in a passive and deterministic process from metaphysical pure reason, nor from the unthinking properties of brute physical matter, and neither is it an unintended consequence of divergent self-seeking desires and interests. It is the product of consciousness, will, and active effort.</blockquote><blockquote>This collective actor is sociologically analogous to the biological organism: a self-reproducing whole that is greater than the sum of its parts, and capable of purposive action oriented towards its own existential preservation</blockquote><blockquote>The modern state is a res publica or commonwealth: a legal corporation created by its members to advance the purposes and administer the goods and affairs they share in common on their behalf.</blockquote><blockquote>Through this collective personification and embodiment, individual-level actors can come to consciousness of their unity in their shared identity as citizens of the same nation-state, and acquire the social solidarity that the likes of religion, kinship, and local allegiances can no longer provide by themselves in highly urbanized, diverse, and mobile societies.</blockquote><blockquote>Consciousness on the part of citizens with respect to the nature and ends of the state—what needs to be done in order to keep the ship of state afloat, what the role and duties of public officers are, etc.—is thus exactly analogous to psychological self-awareness in the natural person: the master regulatory and coordinating principle of behavioral functions that formulates conscious ends, selects appropriate means, and then directs the whole organism towards the attainment of what it needs for self-preservation.</blockquote><blockquote>The degradation of state-oriented consciousness has exactly the same consequences for state and society as those of dementia for the biological organism, namely functional disintegration, and a consecutive level of impairment ranging from the sub-optimal to the fatal.</blockquote><blockquote>Most Western nations sit on an enormous apparatus of power upon which the entirety of the nation’s affairs depends. But it dares not speak its name, and nobody really seems to know just what to do with it.</blockquote><blockquote>The dementia of the state is presently making itself felt in the unfolding crisis of civic unity known as tribalism.</blockquote><blockquote>The preservation of the state as a goal of political life—one both able to act beyond factions and to reconcile them—has been blotted out of public consciousness, replaced by community activism and party politics.</blockquote><blockquote>The activist is a counter-citizen who sees the state not as an end, but as an instrumental means to service the cause, in a complete inversion of the historical sense of the idea of public spirit.</blockquote><blockquote>Ethical action in politics based on an honor system with an expectation of reciprocal fair play makes no sense outside of a self-consciously statist frame of reference, in which an opponent is also a fellow member of the state and seeker of its good.</blockquote><blockquote>In this respect, the real-life state of nature that has obtained within the state, and under its legal monopoly on violence, is potentially much more threatening than anything in Hobbes’ speculative musings.</blockquote><blockquote>The state must become an explicit and irreducible category of analysis and a sociological variable in its own right, alongside the commonplace likes of class, nation, party, race, etc. Instead of taking the state for granted as an immutable fact of life, naively failing to notice or pretending not to notice it, or uncritically accepting ideological strawman attacks against the state as received knowledge, we ought to consciously reflect on it.</blockquote><blockquote>We should strive to discard the euphemisms through which we force the state to think and speak in ideological languages not made for it. If the state has a strategic interest in projecting power abroad somewhere, we should call things by their proper names instead of saying and pretending—or actually believing—that we are promoting freedom and democracy, or some other supposedly higher interest.</blockquote><blockquote>Statecraft, as a highly specialized and technically complicated enterprise, should be accorded at least the same type of deference and the same space of independent action that we accord to STEM and other specialized technical fields of endeavor.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
