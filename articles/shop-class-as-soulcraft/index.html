If you need a deck built, or your car fixed, the Chinese are of no help. Because they are in China.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The effects of my work were visible for all to see, so my competence was real for others as well; it had a social currency. The well-founded pride of the tradesman is far from the gratuitous ‚Äúself-esteem‚Äù that educators would impart to students, as though by magic.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The satisfactions of manifesting oneself concretely in the world through manual competence have been known to make a man quiet and easy.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Hobbyists will tell you that making one‚Äôs own furniture is hard to justify economically. And yet they persist. Shared memories attach to the material souvenirs of our lives, and producing them is a kind of communion, with others and with the future.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Finding myself at loose ends one summer in Berkeley, I built a mahogany coffee table on which I spared no expense of effort. At that time I had no immediate prospect of becoming a father, yet I imagined a child who would form indelible impressions of this table and know that it was his father‚Äôs work.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>‚ÄúThe reality and reliability of the human world rest primarily on the fact that we are surrounded by things more permanent than the activity by which they were produced, and potentially even more permanent than the lives of their authors.‚Äù</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Because craftsmanship refers to objective standards that do not issue from the self and its desires, it poses a challenge to the ethic of consumerism, as the sociologist Richard Sennett has recently argued.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Being able to think materially about material goods, hence critically, gives one some independence from the manipulations of marketing, which typically divert attention from what a thing is to a back-story intimated through associations, the point of which is to exaggerate minor differences between brands.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The tradesman has an impoverished fantasy life compared to the ideal consumer; he is more utilitarian and less given to soaring hopes. But he is also more autonomous.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Political theorists from Aristotle to Thomas Jefferson have questioned the republican virtue of the mechanic, finding him too narrow in his concerns to be moved by the public good.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><h3>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-3rd-2021">March 3rd, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote>Since the standards of craftsmanship issue from the logic of things rather than the art of persuasion, practiced submission to them perhaps gives the craftsman some psychic ground to stand on against fantastic hopes aroused by demagogues, whether commercial or political.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>However narrow in its application, this is a rare appearance in contemporary life ‚Äî a disinterested, articulable, and publicly affirmable idea of the good. Such a strong ontology is somewhat at odds with the cutting-edge institutions of the new capitalism, and with the educational regime that aims to supply those institutions with suitable workers ‚Äî pliable generalists unfettered by any single set of skills.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The egalitarian worry that has always attended tracking students into ‚Äúcollege prep‚Äù and ‚Äúvocational ed‚Äù is overlaid with another: the fear that acquiring a specific skill set means that one‚Äôs life is determined. In college, by contrast, many students don‚Äôt learn anything of particular application; college is the ticket to an open future.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Somehow, every worker in the cutting-edge workplace is now supposed to act like an ‚Äúintrapreneur,‚Äù that is, to be actively involved in the continuous redefinition of his own job.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Shop class presents an image of stasis that runs directly counter to what Richard Sennett identifies as ‚Äúa key element in the new economy‚Äôs idealized self: the capacity to surrender, to give up possession of an established reality.‚Äù This stance toward ‚Äúestablished reality,‚Äù which can only be called psychedelic, is best not indulged around a table saw.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Like the ideal consumer, the management consultant presents an image of soaring freedom, in light of which the manual trades appear cramped and paltry.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>As Sennett argues, most people take pride in being good at something specific, which happens through the accumulation of experience. Yet the flitting disposition is pressed upon workers from above by the current generation of management revolutionaries, for whom the ethic of craftsmanship is actually something to be rooted out from the workforce.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Skilled manual labor entails a systematic encounter with the material world, precisely the kind of encounter that gives rise to natural science.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The steam engine is a good example. It was developed by mechanics who observed the relations between volume, pressure, and temperature. This at a time when theoretical scientists were tied to the caloric theory of heat, which later turned out to be a conceptual dead end. The success of the steam engine contributed to the development of what we now call classical thermodynamics.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Lack of experience diminishes our power of taking a comprehensive view of the admitted facts. Hence those who dwell in intimate association with nature and its phenomena are more able to lay down principles such as to admit of a wide and coherent development; while those whom devotion to abstract discussions has rendered unobservant of facts are too ready to dogmatize on the basis of a few observations.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>More precisely, any algorithmic solution to the crafting problem cannot itself be generated algorithmically, as it must include ad hoc constraints known only through practice, that is, through embodied manipulations. Those constraints cannot be arrived at deductively, starting from mathematical entities. It is worth noting in passing that this has implications for the theory of mind favored by artificial intelligence researchers, as it speaks to the ‚Äúcomputability‚Äù of pragmatic cognition.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>My most reliable source, Fred Cousins in Chicago, had such an encyclopedic knowledge of obscure European motorcycles that all I could offer him in exchange was regular shipments of obscure European beer.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><h3>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-4th-2021">March 4th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote>Socially, being the proprietor of a bike shop in a small city gave me a feeling I never had before. I felt I had a place in society.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Given the intrinsic richness of manual work, cognitively, socially, and in its broader psychic appeal, the question becomes why it has suffered such a devaluation in recent years as a component of education.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>As Lears tells the story, the great irony is that antimodernist sentiments of aesthetic revolt against the machine paved the way for certain unattractive features of late-modern culture: therapeutic self-absorption and the hankering after ‚Äúauthenticity,‚Äù precisely those psychic hooks now relied upon by advertisers. Such spiritualized, symbolic modes of craft practice and craft consumption represented a kind of compensation for, and therefore an accommodation to, new modes of routinized, bureaucratic work.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The tenets of scientific management were given their first and frankest articulation by Frederick Winslow Taylor, an unembarrassed evangelist of efficiency whose Principles of Scientific Management was hugely influential in the early decades of the twentieth century. Stalin was a big fan, as were the founders of the first MBA program, at Harvard, where Taylor was invited to lecture annually.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Thus, according to Taylor, ‚ÄúAll possible brain work should be removed from the shop and centered in the planning or lay-out department.‚Äù</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>‚ÄúThe managers assume ‚Ä¶ the burden of gathering together all of the traditional knowledge which in the past has been possessed by the workmen and then of classifying, tabulating, and reducing this knowledge to rules, laws, and formulae.‚Äù</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Taylor writes that the ‚Äúfull possibilities‚Äù of his system ‚Äúwill not have been realized until almost all of the machines in the shop are run by men who are of smaller caliber and attainments, and who are therefore cheaper than those required under the old system.‚Äù</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The activity (in the Aristotelian sense) of self-directed labor, conducted by the worker, is dissolved into abstract parts and then reconstituted as a process controlled by management.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Knots here, shakes there, rind-galls, waney edges (edges with more or less bark in them), thicknesses, thinnesses, were for ever affording new chances or forbidding previous solutions, whereby a fresh problem confronted the workman‚Äôs ingenuity every few minutes. He had no band-saw (as now [1923]) to drive, with ruthless unintelligence, through every resistance. The timber was far from being prey, a helpless victim, to a machine. Rather it would lend its own special virtues to the man who knew how to humour it.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Indeed, 1907 saw the publication of a book with the immodest title The New Basis of Civilization, by Simon Nelson Patten, in which the moral valence of debt and spending is reversed, and the multiplication of wants becomes not a sign of dangerous corruption but part of the civilizing process.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The trades are then a natural home for anyone who would live by his own powers, free not only of deadening abstraction, but also of the insidious hopes and rising insecurities that seem to be endemic in our current economic life. This is the stoic ideal.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section></article></html>
