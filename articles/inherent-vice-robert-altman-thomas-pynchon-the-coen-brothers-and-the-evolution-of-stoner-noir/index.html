In so doing, they tell us something about both the real world, and the story-telling conventions we employ to represent it in fiction.</blockquote><blockquote>Stoner noir certainly replaces the unflappable, sardonic hero of the hardboiled detective novel with a type of fool – the pothead being an ideal modern archetype of the fool, a figure whose fraught relationship with the hardships and nuisances of everyday life we can all identity with to some extent.</blockquote><blockquote>Hunter S. Thompson’s “high and beautiful wave” had crashed, leaving in its wake a flotsam of glazed pleasure seekers, health faddists, and pop psychologies, all of which hovered satellite-like around the nebulous concept of the “self.”</blockquote><blockquote>The Long Goodbye’s significance to the stoner noir cannon lies primarily in the fact that is almost impossible to imagine The Big Lebowski without it.</blockquote><blockquote>Vast sociological desertions and studies might be written about precisely why <a class="ref" href="/topics/the-big-lebowski">The Big Lebowski</a> struck such an indelible chord with a fairly large sub-set of the film-viewing public – particularly men of a certain generation.</blockquote><blockquote>The idea of plots – complex, puzzling, sometimes illusory - ties together the various strands of this story like a good Moroccan rug.</blockquote><blockquote>In a sense, the idea of a plot has always connected the world of the detective and that of the stoner – the good detective story requiring a plot above all else, and the stoner often being subject to the conspiranoid intimation that everything might be some kind of plot.</blockquote><blockquote>Joel Coen said of Lebowksi that they wanted to “do a Chandler kind of story – how it moves episodically, and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that’s ultimately unimportant.” For this reason, the “plot” of <a class="ref" href="/topics/the-big-lebowski">The Big Lebowski</a> unravels and evaporates in the last act into a fog of misdirection and misapprehension which the various actors had fashioned around an illusory kidnapping. This relates also to the paranoia of potheads, and the literary paranoia of Pynchon’s work.</blockquote><blockquote>The paranoiac’s grand plot also tends to evaporate and vanish, either at the point where the paranoiac realizes that the plot was, all along, a creation of his or her possibly weed-befogged brain – or, at the point where the plot reaches it maximal state of complexity, and hence vanishes because it has become everything and nothing.</blockquote></div></section><section class="mt-2"><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/2021-02-26">February 26th, 2021</a></h3><div><p>I learned about this concept in a great blog post from 2014, by the presumably pseudonymous Tristan Eldritch, called <a class="ref" href="/articles/inherent-vice-robert-altman-thomas-pynchon-the-coen-brothers-and-the-evolution-of-stoner-noir">📰 Inherent Vice: Robert Altman, Thomas Pynchon, the Coen Brothers, and the Evolution of Stoner Noir</a>.</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
