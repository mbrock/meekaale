Boundaries are, roughly, perceptual illusions, created by our brains. Moreover, which boundaries we see depends on what we are doing—on our purposes.</blockquote><blockquote id="dN06YHG1T">However, boundaries are not just arbitrary human creations. The world is immensely diverse. Some bits of it stick together much more than other bits. Some bits connect with each other in many ways besides just stickiness. The world is, in other words, patterned as well as nebulous.</blockquote><blockquote id="v2JgwTqor">However, the idea that the world is not made up of clearly separable objects, but is also not just one big blur, may be unfamiliar.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
