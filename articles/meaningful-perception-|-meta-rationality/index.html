Needing to learn new visual skills is unusual for adults.</blockquote><blockquote id="Sqg8qtW5Z">Much of what you see, you see as something. You donâ€™t see a textured black region of the visual image, you see a loudspeaker. Or a raven. Itâ€™s already a loudspeaker or a raven when you first experience it. Bottom-up vision has done that work for you.</blockquote><blockquote id="IUaVFg55p">What you see something as depends on your knowledge, context, and purposes. If you are familiar with moussaka and you see it on a plate in a restaurant, youâ€™ll probably see it as moussaka. If you arenâ€™t, youâ€™ll probably see it as a mushy casserole. You canâ€™t see it as moussaka, because thatâ€™s not part of your <a class="ref" href="/topics/ontology">Ontology</a>.</blockquote><blockquote id="73-WX-3xM">Because perception evolved to enable purposeful activities, most of the time it reveals meaningful functions and potentials. Those are a matter of <a class="ref" href="/topics/ontology">Ontology</a>: not just categories, but also how you separate the world into objects; what properties you see them having; and how they relate to each other.</blockquote><blockquote id="hTkiQpUq5">Itâ€™s not just objects, but also intentions, actions, events, environments, and possibilities. In context, you see someone kneeling as worship; someone running out of a store as shoplifting; and items on a restaurant table as a dinner setting, not a silverware collection.</blockquote><blockquote id="gOpWxElEE">Routine activity is easy because most of the time we can see what to do. We see affordancesâ€”cues as to what actions are possible, and what their effects will be. When itâ€™s time for a snack, looking around inside the refrigerator reveals what you feel like eating.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
