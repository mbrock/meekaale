Furthermore, this isn’t inherently dysfunctional, nor indicative of something like Dissociative Identity Disorder. Rather, even people who are entirely healthy and normal may experience this kind of “multiplicity”.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>In the book Richard Schwartz, the developer of IFS, notes that if a person’s subagents play well together, then that person is likely to feel mostly internally unified. On the other hand, if a person has lots of internal conflict, then they are more likely to experience themselves as having multiple parts with conflicting desires.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>I’ve frequently been very dysfunctional, and have always found very intuitive the notion of the mind being split into very parts. Yet I mostly still don’t seem to experience my subagents anywhere near as person-like as some others clearly do.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>I now think that “being in Self” represents a state where there no particular subagent is getting a disproportionate share of voting power, and everything is processed by the system as a whole.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section><section><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/march-6th-2021">March 6th, 2021</a></h3><div><p>In Kaj Sotala's article <a class="ref" href="/articles/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model"> Building Up to an Internal Family Systems Model</a>, he writes:</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
