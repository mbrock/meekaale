Furthermore, this isn’t inherently dysfunctional, nor indicative of something like Dissociative Identity Disorder. Rather, even people who are entirely healthy and normal may experience this kind of “multiplicity”.</blockquote><blockquote id="cXwikwMB9">In the book Richard Schwartz, the developer of IFS, notes that if a person’s subagents play well together, then that person is likely to feel mostly internally unified. On the other hand, if a person has lots of internal conflict, then they are more likely to experience themselves as having multiple parts with conflicting desires.</blockquote><blockquote id="6LxM_RgXh">I’ve frequently been very dysfunctional, and have always found very intuitive the notion of the mind being split into very parts. Yet I mostly still don’t seem to experience my subagents anywhere near as person-like as some others clearly do.</blockquote><blockquote id="XxyjQIiIV">I now think that “being in Self” represents a state where there no particular subagent is getting a disproportionate share of voting power, and everything is processed by the system as a whole.</blockquote></div></section><section class="mt-2"><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/2021-03-06">March 6th, 2021</a></h3><div><p>In Kaj Sotala's article <a class="ref" href="/articles/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model">📰 Building Up to an Internal Family Systems Model</a>, he writes:</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
