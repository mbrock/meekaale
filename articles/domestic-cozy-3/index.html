Applying Jungian magical thinking, we should expect this projection to be anything but cozy. The shadow of domestic cozy ought to be a particular pattern of public strife. We should expect this strife to have a recognizably domestic heat signature â€” the ugly family scene rather than the barroom brawl, soccer riot, or gang war.</blockquote><blockquote id="7BjRtr625">The term domestic cozy evokes peaceful ASMRish imagery â€” comfort, safety, relaxation, intimacy, trust. Its outward, public-facing projection, however, reverses all that. It is associated with discomfort, aggression, stress, hostility, and distrust.</blockquote><blockquote id="6o1fpvciC">We can unpack it in somewhat more detail if we assume the default Zoomer social unit, irrespective of context, to be the <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a>. The term fam, which apparently originated in black culture a couple of decades ago, has in recent years crossed over into mainstream usage. I think the driver has probably been the Zoomer need for an overloaded notion of <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a>. The Zoomer experience of the world is a strong pack experience in an unflattened Hobbesian world. Zoomers navigate the world in <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a>-like fictive-kin groups to a relatively greater extent than older generations, because they were raised to believe that the world beyond <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a> is devolving into apocalyptic chaos (which may or may not be true).</blockquote><blockquote id="_MKDiTb-_">If Millennials act like theyâ€™re always in public, performing for an imagined audience, and Gen Xers act like theyâ€™re solitary, invisible, cyberpunk antiheroes hacking their way through futuristic technology-stack underbellies, Zoomers act like theyâ€™re always at home with <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a>, with the concomitant expectations of safety, intimacy, and trust. When those expectations are stressed, they react the way families do under threat, with the aggression of <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a> members responding to a threat to one of their own.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
