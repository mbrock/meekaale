I knew what that was: a consolation prize. And since I wasn't a sore loser, I decided I didn't need meaning of either variety, Ultimate or man-made.</blockquote><blockquote id="tJ6FCpeyQ">In lieu of meaning, I mostly adopted the attitude of Alan Watts. Existence, he says, is fundamentally playful. It's less like a journey, and more like a piece of music or a dance. And the point of dancing isn't to arrive at a particular spot on the floor; the point of dancing is simply to dance. Vonnegut expresses a similar sentiment when he says, "We are here on Earth to fart around."</blockquote><blockquote id="1AGNxNyRE">Now, to be honest, I'm not sure whether I'm a full-bodied practitioner of Watts's or Vonnegut's brand of nihilism. Deep down, maybe I still yearn for more than dancing and farting.</blockquote><blockquote id="nbSRYAc_7">Unfortunately, some of my favorite writers of recent years — Sarah Perry and David Chapman, in particular — can't seem to shut up about meaning.</blockquote><blockquote id="D6DzdHCWQ">Supposing there's no ultimate, objective, metaphysical thing called meaning, we might instead approach it as a certain feeling or perception that people have toward the objects, events, and experiences in their lives, or toward their lives as a whole.</blockquote><blockquote id="nZujR-pjk">So: meaning isn't a substance, but rather a feeling. In this way, it's a lot like beauty. Both are more-or-less subjective experiences that we perceive in response to external cues.</blockquote><blockquote id="9SI2qV_Kk">Both meaning and beauty are experiences we seem to crave, and the fact that all humans have these cravings suggests that they're adaptive. And just as we can appreciate beauty without getting too philosophical about it, so too can we appreciate meaning without requiring it to rest on some ultimate, metaphysical foundation.</blockquote><blockquote id="preVokxqK">In the context of a play, Chekhov's gun is meaningful if and only if it's fired in the final act. If the gun is never fired (or is otherwise irrelevant to the plot), then it's meaningless — not a prop, but mere set dressing. And just as we find narratives unsatisfying when the elements in them don't pay off later, so too do we appreciate when things pay off meaningfully in our lives and the other contexts we care about. Otherwise it's just one damn thing after another.</blockquote><blockquote id="NsZC_IzuB">A thing X will be perceived as meaningful in context C to the extent that it's connected to other meaningful things in C.</blockquote><blockquote id="1QPec2fjU">Sarah gives a helpful metaphor: meaning is pointing. So the more arrows issuing out from something, the greater its meaning</blockquote><blockquote id="pFzw4FubA">By these measures — connectedness, pointing intensity, effects of removal — the Constitution is far and away the most meaningful document in the United States.</blockquote><blockquote id="YhuROKD_L">Similar logic tells us that, in the context of a growing startup, early hires are more meaningful than later hires, largely because they have more influence on how the company develops.</blockquote><blockquote id="pwNolT29T">Second, note the recursion: the meaning of a thing is defined by its connections to other meaningful things. This may seem circular or question-begging, but I think that's precisely the point.</blockquote><blockquote id="UsvnNFuL_">Of course, the buck has to stop somewhere, at some source of inherent or axiomatic meaning. In a religious context, for example, God is the ultimate arbiter of what is or isn't meaningful.</blockquote><blockquote id="MT0zEkL5U">Third, note that meaning, if defined in terms of connections, isn't entirely a matter of subjective experience. It has some objective qualities, some entanglements with reality.</blockquote><blockquote id="BnEhQpf1Q">Finally, if meaning is about connectedness, and especially causal influence, we can see why it's adaptive to pursue meaning.</blockquote></div><h3 id="inyaaGik2">Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-02">March 2nd, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote id="tBeYaqP9Y">Perceptions of meaning allow us to answer a question we're always asking ourselves, "Why am I bothering to do this?" If an activity feels meaningful, it merits our continued attention and investment. Whereas if it feels meaningless, an appropriate response is to stop doing it — to give up and search for a more meaningful path.</blockquote><blockquote id="ywMSI19_G">Just as boredom and ennui are emotions that prompt us to make better use of our time or to look for other opportunities, our perceptions of meaning (or lack thereof) prompt us to think about the deepest, longest-term impact of our actions, and to steer toward better outcomes.</blockquote><blockquote id="Bzx08qnQN">The least meaningful life, for example, is the causal dead-end — a person so inessential and irrelevant that the world doesn't so much as bat an eyelash when they die. A hermit who spends his whole life alone in the woods, perhaps. Or someone who toils in utter obscurity, leaving no children and no other mark on the world.</blockquote><blockquote id="BXQEfErC7">On the other hand, the most meaningful life is the one on which everything depends: the fate of humanity, Good triumphing over Evil, etc.</blockquote><blockquote id="WowEATeVu">We love hearing stories about characters who experience these epic heights of meaning: Harry Potter, Ender Wiggin, Frodo Baggins. Or consider Jesus's life and his death on the cross, which arguably hits harder on the human "meaning bone" than any other narrative ever constructed.</blockquote><blockquote id="gur_w5sr0">Now we can't all be Jesus or Harry Potter, of course. But if meaning is pointing, then the meaning of one's life must reside in the arrows that point outward from it, influencing the <a class="ref" href="/topics/external">External</a> world. That's why we so often talk about meaningful activities in generic terms like "connecting with others," "paying it forward," "having an impact," "leaving a legacy," or participating in something "bigger than oneself."</blockquote><blockquote id="oojoaepDa">None of this is to say that Alan Watts or Kurt Vonnegut are wrong, or that we must do something meaningful with our lives. But to the extent that our brains were built to seek meaning, we won't be able to quench our thirst by dancing around or making fart apps. So we're left with a <a class="ref" href="/topics/choice">Choice</a>: either we strive to make a meaningful difference in the world, or else learn to face the void without flinching, and to find peace in simple being.</blockquote><blockquote id="r8cfbAI7X">But the bigger reason to separate meaning from pleasure is that pleasure is a strictly subjective experience. You can close your eyes and bliss out as hard as you like, and the pleasure you experience will be no less valid because it's "just in your mind." Meaning, on the other hand, is entangled with <a class="ref" href="/topics/external">External</a> reality, making it possible to be wrong about it. And thus the pursuit of true meaning requires an outward orientation to the world.</blockquote><blockquote id="dRfGyfD1E">Every action you take to benefit someone else is an arrow pointing outside yourself and influencing the <a class="ref" href="/topics/external">External</a> world.</blockquote><blockquote id="bqiUjhYLN">Joining a community and seeking fame are just two examples of a more general way to maximize meaning: pursuing network centrality.</blockquote><blockquote id="ShBcn9pNZ">All religions create copious amounts of meaning for their adherents.</blockquote><blockquote id="V08tMEMoT">The prospect that humans might someday spread out through the galaxy (and beyond?) creates meaning on an epic scale.</blockquote><blockquote id="9rM9QW79w">Yes, science tells us that we're rounding error in terms of size and energy consumption. But in terms of complexity, we're huge. As far as we know, we and our societies take the prize for being the most complex structures the universe has yet evolved. And thanks to our ingenuity, there are more things deserving of study on the surface of one planet (Earth) than in the entire rest of the known universe.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
