I suspect I was doing some combination of cutting off blood flow to the affected areas, restricting lymphatic circulation, and keeping myself in a state of SNS activation (and wakefulness) that suppresses immune function systemwide.</blockquote><blockquote id="dGmcXFg-Y">Blaming yourself for a demonic infestation is like blaming yourself for having a cold. It harms you and those around you. You can act to reduce the harm it causes. Maybe your decisions made it more likely. You can investigate this and make better-informed decisions in the future. Self-rejection actually impedes your recovery.</blockquote><blockquote id="HSREe8JQ6">Judaism imagines reality as an infinitely dominant male who hates anti-epistemology more than anything else.</blockquote><blockquote id="Q_QN7s_Nu">Calvinism cultivates the self-fulfilling expectation of being helplessly drawn towards the attractor of mimicking good, productive behavior (irresistible grace) despite one's badness (total depravity).</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
