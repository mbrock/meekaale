It is premised on the idea that life is full of randomness punctuated by sudden moments â€“ crises and opportunities â€“ with vast potential for meaning making, when our skills and virtues shine.</blockquote><blockquote id="T7fJaioUr">This approach to the problem of meaning recognizes that, rather than trying to discern a mission, it is better to become a certain kind of person â€“ a person who is capable of acting on and recognizing opportunities to make meaning when they are seen.</blockquote><blockquote id="V9Bw5mw3D">Sometimes it is, in fact, necessary to put others first â€“ you may have to take time out from your career or hobby to care for a child or an ailing parent, or to help your community or nation deal with some crisis. You may realize that you are spending too much time in the workshop and not enough time with your children. But taken too far, this thinking can also produce crippled, resentful individuals who give back only a fraction of what they would have if they were flourishing. Your children need to be fed, clothed and educated, and they need your love and guidance â€“ but they also need to see you happy and engaged with life.</blockquote><blockquote id="BrUSh0ZIW">This approach to meaning â€“ becoming a certain kind of person who can act appropriately in response to opportunities for meaning making â€“ lends itself well to a particular school of meta-ethics, which is virtue ethics.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
