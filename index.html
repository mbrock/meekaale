It's almost my bedtime and I only had time to read a little bit but I'm excited to read more.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>I'm trying to write these daily notes, I skipped yesterday so I'll do a quick thing now.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>In Section 3, "Conceptualism vs Realism," Travers brings up <a class="ref" href="/topics/barry-smith">Barry Smith</a> as a proponent of realism in ontological representation, and criticizes this realist position.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>It's an interesting question and I'm not committed to any view but I suspect Smith's position might be a bit more sympathetic and nuanced than the position Travers criticizes. For example, Travers quotes this paragraph by Smith:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The influence of the concept-centered view ... has become entrenched also in virtue of the fact that much work on ontology has been concerned with representations of domains, such as commerce, law, or public administration, where we are dealing with the products of human convention and agreement – and thus with entities which are in some sense merely ‘conceptual’. Today, however, we are facing a situation where ontologies are increasingly being developed in close cooperation with those working at the interface between the informatics disciplines and the empirical sciences, and under these conditions the concept-centered view is exerting a damaging influence on the progress of ontology.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Travers summarizes:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>This is a very clear statement of the metaphysical basis of Smith’s approach to ontology – the physical (or empirical) is real, while the social consists of “mere” concepts.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>This is a very plausible reading, but then in Smith's <a class="ref" href="/books/building-ontologies-with-basic-formal-ontology"> Building Ontologies With Basic Formal Ontology</a>, we can read:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Ontological realism applies equally to all branches of science, taking the view that, for example, collateralized debt obligations are no less real than electrons and planets. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>So that's a clear statement in a seemingly opposite direction: here a commercial, legal, accounting entity is no less real than an electron.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Maybe Smith is inconsistent, but my reading is different. It's not that social reality is merely conceptual and therefore less real.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>I understand Smith's problem with conceptualism from this rather funny paragraph in <a class="ref" href="/books/building-ontologies-with-basic-formal-ontology"> Building Ontologies With Basic Formal Ontology</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED), a leading international clinical terminology, defined a “disorder” in releases up to 2010 as “a concept in which there is an explicit or implicit pathological process causing a state of disease which tends to exist for a significant length of time under ordinary circumstances.” At the same time it defined “concepts” as “unique units of thought.” From this it follows that a disorder is a unit of thought in which there is a pathological process causing a state of disease, so that to eradicate a disorder would involve eradicating a unit of thought. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>This seems to describe an ontological error in a high-profile medical ontology that's a direct consequence of an habitual tendency to define classes as subclasses of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/concept">Concept</a> entity.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Smith states his commitment to the realist stance as follows:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>ontologies are representations of reality, not of people’s concepts or mental representations or uses of language. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>This is a bit confusing because I'm quite sure he doesn't mean to imply that concepts, representations, or utterances are not real parts of reality. Instead he's criticizing a tendency to define the root entities in ontologies as denoting concepts.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>But I'm looking forward to reading further in Travers's article to learn about other approaches to thinking about scientific ontologies, because Smith is basically the only source I've read!</p><div class="indent"></div><p>I was impressed by Smith's commitment to "perspectivalism," "fallibilism," and "adequatism." Three quotes demonstrating each of those:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The implications of <strong>perspectivalism</strong> for ontology are that the irreducibility of different perspectives should be respected also in the design of ontologies. Ontology developers should not seek to represent all portions and features of reality in a single ontology, but should seek, rather, a modular approach, in which each module is maintained as far as possible by experts in the corresponding scientific discipline. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Some specific implications of <strong>fallibilism</strong> for ontology design in support of scientific research include the following: That every ontology must have sophisticated strategies for keeping track of successive versions of the ontology. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote><strong>Adequatism</strong> [...] holds that the entities in any given domain should be taken seriously on their own terms and that room must be made in our set of theories of reality for all of the different sorts of entities that reality contains, at all levels of granularity [...] For the adequatist all scientific disciplines are prima facie of equal worth in providing representations of what exists in reality.  <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Together, these commitments made it seem to me that Barry Smith's realist ontology design is actually in line with pragmatism. His realism doesn't seem like any kind of scientistic chauvinism or a distaste for tentative conceptual schemes that prefers to die on the hill of imaginary perfect correspondence. Rather he seems to be working together with practicing scientific communities in order to help formalize the practically realist ontologies that they are already working with.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>But I'm not sure!</p><div class="indent"></div></div></section></article><article><section><h1>March 13th, 2021</h1><h2><strong>Note</strong>: Cultivating the Breath as a Symbol</h2><div class="indent"><p>Glenn Wallis wrote the following in his introduction to Buddhist meditation:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The Sanskrit word <em>bhavanā</em> is commonly translated into English as "meditation." But that’s too fancy. It really just means "bringing into being," or even more simply, "cultivation." A farmer performs <em>bhavanā</em> when he prepares the soil, plants seed, and protects and nourishes the seedling. When the sun shines, when rain falls, and when the temperature remains just so, that, too, helps to nurture the seed. Cultivated in this fashion, the seed becomes a beautiful, vibrant, and health-giving plant. This is <em>bhavanā</em>.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>I remember hearing this years ago when I was really into Buddhist meditation. It sounds nice: nourishing something, growing vegetables, very wholesome. Reading it now, it seems like a very powerful and interesting metaphor.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Rather, it used to seem like a pleasant metaphor, and now it seems almost like a literal description. The mind is not literally a plot of land, but it is a fertile medium that hosts an ecosystem of growing beings.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>I picture it by visualizing the brain as a living neural network. This is not neuroscientific; I just find this imagery useful, probably because the neural network structure is so diagrammatic and spatial.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Let's assume we're doing a simple meditation of the kind that Buddhists call <em>anapanasati</em>, mindfulness of the breath.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>At first it's not obvious what it means to focus on the breath. It's a complex messy bodily function, not a pristine symbol. But we begin to make a symbol out of it.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>We might use words like "in, out" or counting to ten. These are readymade symbols that we know how to focus on, and so we begin to use them as anchors, forming connections between them and the whole rushing flow of sensations and intentions that is the breath. But we're not overwriting the symbolic meaning of the words and numbers, we're making a new thing, a new cluster, a new nexus. These preliminary anchoring symbols work as training wheels.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>I'm mixing all kinds of metaphors and analogies, but whatever.</p><div class="indent"></div><p><a class="ref" href="/topics/john-vervaeke">John Vervaeke</a> explains how the breath in meditation becomes a symbol in episode 35 of <a class="ref" href="/topics/awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis">Awakening from the Meaning Crisis</a>.</p><div class="indent"></div><p><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rpivf1SoEdc"></iframe></p><div class="indent"></div><p>His use of the concept <a class="ref" href="/topics/symbol">Symbol</a> here is very different from the use in terms like "symbolic reasoning." A symbol for Vervaeke is not just any linguistic signifier or an algebraic variable. It's more like the kind of use in "the lion is a symbol of strength" or the Christian cross.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Vervaeke's first example of a symbol in this sense is the scales of justice. He looks at that symbol from an embodied cognitive science perspective, claiming that it's not just a nice metaphor. The symbol identifies justice as involving <em>balance</em>, and we can use the link to the vivid embodied image of the scales to activate our actual capacity for balance. Physical balancing is associated with the brain's cerebellum, and Vervaeke explains that attuning to the symbol of the scales is a way to light up these neural circuits to bring our learned sense of balancing to bear when making ethical decisions.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>That's interesting. I don't know enough to judge it as a scientific claim.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Meditating on the breath, the breath itself becomes a symbol in that sense. Instead of the associations with balancing, we connect to the qualities of the breath: the way it comes and goes like waves on the shore; the way it's wispy and nebulous; the way it's ephemeral like clouds in the sky; its beauty and wholesomeness. And this whole nexus of symbolic resonance is something we can bring to bear on life and the world.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>As we maintain a regular meditation practice, we cultivate and clarify this structure, this circuit, this growth.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Another quote from Glenn Wallis:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>One of the Buddha’s favorite metaphors for the practice that we refer to as “meditation” is <em>bhavanā</em>, “cultivation.” He certainly had in mind the ubiquitous farms and fields of his native India when employing this image. Thus, unlike “meditation” or “contemplation,” the Buddha’s term is musty, rich, verdant. It smells of the earth. The commonness of his chosen term—it would have resonated with a farmer—suggested naturalness, everydayness, ordinariness. The term also suggested hope: no matter how fallow it has become or damaged it may be, a field can always be cultivated—endlessly enhanced, enriched, developed—to produce a favorable and nourishing harvest. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>I think the cultivated entity in breath meditation is an example of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/weird-fishes">Weird Fishes</a> I've been writing about. It seems useful to have this way of thinking about it, as an alternative to thinking about it in the more abstract, transcendental, pure way that meditation is often described.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>That's also why I find it interesting to think of meditation as nurturing a <a class="ref" href="/topics/selfoid">Selfoid</a> with certain qualities, rather than as a practice of "no-self." If meditating on the breath creates and reinforces a selfoid, that makes it similar in my little framework to nursing an addiction.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>I mention addictions because that's the example Kevin Simler used in <a class="ref" href="/articles/hallucinated-gods"> Hallucinated Gods</a> of a contemporary type of pseudo-demonic agent inside the brain, which I mentioned in <a href="/days/march-6th-2021"><strong>Note</strong>: More Weird Fishes: Gods, Languages, Addictions</a>.</p><div class="indent"></div><p><a href="/days/march-6th-2021"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmikaelogy%2FnJNFgHv5c-.png?alt=media&amp;token=2b0dfd97-6340-4da5-a1ba-9adf6f1f16d8"></a></p><div class="indent"></div><p>We don't usually think of smoking tobacco as similar to meditation, more like the opposite, but it's actually a vivid symbolic practice. Even Ayn Rand viewed her beloved cigarettes like this:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>When a man thinks, there is a spot of fire alive in his mind—and it is proper that he should have the burning point of a cigarette as his one expression.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>David Abram's <a class="ref" href="/books/the-spell-of-the-sensuous"> The Spell of the Sensuous</a> describes the pipe-smoking of the Lakota people:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The pipe smoke makes the invisible breath visible, and as it rises from the pipe, it makes visible the flows and currents in the air itself, makes visible the unseen connections between those who smoke the pipe in offering and all other entities that dwell within the world: the winged peoples, the other walking and crawling peoples, and the multiple rooted beings—trees, grasses, shrubs, mosses. Further, the rising smoke carries the prayers of the Lakota people to the sky beings—to the sun and the moon, to the stars, to the thunder beings and the clouds, to all those powers embraced by <em>woniya wakan</em>, the holy air. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Here, smoking is a meditative practice that cultivates an embodied symbolic attunement quite similar to that of breath meditation, but more vividly related to the interconnectedness of beings mediated by the "holy air." The pipe is a portable device that lets you light up a self that sees the world in a certain way. So it's like incense.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Now I'm thinking that pipe-smoking itself could be an embodied symbol for breath meditation. You arrange the tobacco just right, not too tight & not too loose, you light a match and do some initial puffs to stoke the fire, then you keep drawing steadily and calmly to let the material burn nicely. With every draw of the breath, the glowing bundle lights up and intensifies.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>There are a lot of symbols like these for meditation. Looking at a candle's flame is a classic form of meditation. I see them as seeds and roots for cultivating meditative selves.</p><div class="indent"></div></div></section><section><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/book-review-seeing-like-a-state"> Book Review: Seeing Like a State</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-13th-2021">March 13th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/elderblog-sutra-12"> Elderblog Sutra: 12</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-13th-2021">March 13th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/sandersons-first-law-|-brandon-sanderson"> Sanderson's First Law | Brandon Sanderson</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-13th-2021">March 13th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/basic-teachings-of-the-buddha"> Basic Teachings of the Buddha</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-13th-2021">March 13th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-utopia-of-rules"> The Utopia of Rules</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-13th-2021">March 13th, 2021</a>.</p><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-13th-2021">March 13th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article><article><section><h1>March 12th, 2021</h1><h2><strong>Note</strong>: An Evil-Gazed Heteronym</h2><div class="indent"><p>I want to spawn a heteronym to write a future post here.

He finds the slimy multiplicity of the world repulsive. In a carpenter's workshop, he puts his own hand in the workbench vise and tightens it:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>“Oh, sir, it will break bones—beware, beware!” shouts the astonished carpenter. “No fear,” says Ahab, “I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold, man.” <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Ishmael, the protagonist, is free from this mania. Instead he can dwell in multiplicity, make friends of strangers, participate gladly in foreign pagan rituals.</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Ishmael’s polytheistic view finds in the communal rituals of daily life, contradictory and polysemic and plural as they are, the meanings that can drive away the drizzly November of the soul. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><h3>Selfoids</h3><div class="indent"></div><p>The inner multiplicity that thrives beneath the composite meta-self has been the theme of my previous posts: <a href="/days/march-4th-2021"><strong>Note</strong>: Shelter from the Storm</a>, <a href="/days/march-5th-2021"><strong>Note</strong>: Weird Fishes</a>, <a href="/days/march-6th-2021"><strong>Note</strong>: More Weird Fishes: Gods, Languages, Addictions</a>, <a href="/days/march-7th-2021"><strong>Note</strong>: Weird Fishes and Virtue</a>, and <a href="/days/march-9th-2021"><strong>Note</strong>: George Herbert Mead on Selves and Unity</a>.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>This is an ancient idea with many variations.

If when looking outside of ourselves for religious authority we believe in a unitary God, then when we look inside of ourselves we will likely search for a single self. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>They quote Pamela Cooper-White replacing the core self with a braided fabric:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>So what does hold each of us together as healthy “multiples”? If we are not, as we once imagined bound by the gravity of an inner core, what keeps us from flying to pieces? What keeps our healthy multiplicity from dissolving into unhealthy splitting, or even fragmentation? . . . There is a thread, or threads, holding together the fabric of our mental lives. . . . Rather than identifying this thread as a singular conscious identity formation, I proposed a metaphor for the multiple self as braid, whose strength derives precisely from the interweaving of its disparate conscious and unconscious threads. . . . This web or net of threads, taken together, constitutes a “whole”—but a whole whose very coherence and binding power is made up of our multiple subjective experiences and states of being-in-relation. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>I suppose these threads must be related to narratives.</p><div class="indent"></div><h3>Plotoids</h3><div class="indent"></div><p>Coping with a tangle of <a class="ref" href="/topics/plotoids">Plotoids</a> was the theme of <a href="/days/february-26th-2021"><strong>Note</strong>: Losing the Plot — Ethics and The Big Lebowski</a>.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>The plot of <a class="ref" href="/topics/the-big-lebowski">The Big Lebowski</a> starts with a dramatic scene where a gang of confused thugs, having mistaken the stoner protagonist for a wealthy old man with the same last name, break into his house and end up pissing on the beautiful rug that "really tied the room together."</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Of course I suggest that the "desecration" of the Dude's rug symbolizes the breakdown in coherent overarching narratives, and when the Dude complains about having "a lotta strands to keep in my head, man" he's describing a frazzled fabric of plotoids.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>The treatment of <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> in <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a> can seem to imply a nostalgia for the great coherent narratives of ancient societies, but MacIntyre's pluralism promotes another understanding. City-states are not necessarily empires. I think the stories MacIntyre talks about here are primarily plotoids:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Deprive children of stories and you leave them unscripted, anxious stutterers in their actions as in their words. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><h3>The Question</h3><div class="indent"></div><p>It would seem that a main question then is how to respond to multiplicity. In Jordan Peterson's new book <a class="ref" href="/books/beyond-order"> Beyond Order</a>, we find a lucid description of one option:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>It is necessary to lift your eyes above the horizon, to establish a transcendent goal, if you wish to cease being a puppet, under the control of things you do not understand and perhaps do not want to understand. Then all the subsystems or subpersonalities that might otherwise be pursing their own limited fulfillment will join together under the aegis of the truly ideal, and the consequence of that will be an engagement that approximates the ultimate or total. Under such conditions, all the parts of you are going to be on board. That is the psychological equivalent of monotheism. That is the emergence of the higher self that might be the true servant of God, in whatever metaphysical reality potentially underlies what is obvious to our blind and limited mortal selves. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>I have quite a few sources for other options.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>From <a class="ref" href="/books/all-things-shining"> All Things Shining</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The multiple meanings of the universe simply don’t add up to a single, universal truth. Our only hope is to engage in each of them fully, live contentedly in the truths they reveal, but feel no urge to reconcile them to one another. The image for this kind of plural polytheism is neither the deafening chaos of white noise nor the dumb blankness of the color white. Rather, it is the rainbow that separates out the colors of the spectrum, and reveals each in its own wonderful hue. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>From <a class="ref" href="/books/being-ecological"> Being Ecological</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Sometimes I think, ‘Really? I have to assemble a huge group of humans and start a revolution right now, then I can relate to polar bears?’ But awareness of the sensuous existence of other lifeforms doesn’t have to involve big ideas or actions.

It begins to develop when individuals interact with others and play roles. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>How then does a self arise? Here Mead introduces his well-known neologism, the generalized other. When children or adults take roles, they can be said to be playing these roles in dyads. However, this sort of exchange is quite different from the more complex sets of behaviors that are required to participate in games. In the latter, we are required to learn not only the responses of specific others, but behaviors associated with every position on the field. These can be internalized, and when we succeed in doing so we come to “view” our own behaviors from the perspective of the game as a whole, which is a system of organized actions. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The organized community or social group which gives to the individual his unity of self may be called “the generalized other.” The attitude of the generalized other is the attitude of the whole community. Thus, for example, in the case of such a social group as a ball team, the team is the generalized other in so far as it enters—as an organized process or social activity—into the experience of any one of the individual members of it. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Then some more in-depth stuff from an article called <a class="ref" href="/articles/george-herbert-mead-and-the-unity-of-the-self"> George Herbert Mead and the Unity of the Self</a> with my emphases in bold:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>For Mead, individuals can have multiple social selves, which are linked to groups and communities. <strong>Is there a unity or continuity to the self, a type of meta-self, that transcends these social selves</strong>, and if so, how are we to understand it? <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>It would be difficult to appreciate his commitment to self-realization and self-assertion, for example, if we were to restrict their relevance to selves that exist only in relationship to specific communities. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Through Mead’s sensitivity to the ways in which sociality informs self development his work can complement well-known narrative accounts of the self in thinkers such as <a class="ref" href="/topics/hannah-arendt">Hannah Arendt</a>, <a class="ref" href="/topics/alasdair-macintyre">Alasdair MacIntyre</a>, and <a class="ref" href="/topics/charles-taylor">Charles Taylor</a>. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Mead was of two minds about the notion of multiple personalities or selves. On the one hand, he thought multiple personalities quite normal, in the sense in which we have different “selves,” identities, based on the organized groups or communities of which we are members. On the other hand, it should be seen as pathological when there is no connection between these personalities or selves. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>There is a tendency still further to bring all of these different selves within a single self. We get that in the “abstract man,” but there are others; “citizen” may include the other selves. This tendency to organize the different selves is essential for normal social conduct. There are relative degrees of dissociation in all of us. <strong>This self which takes in all the different selves is still the self that answers to the others. It is not the primary self but the composite.</strong> Out of such selves arise conceptions of the political man, the economic man, the object of charity, etc. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote><strong>The unity and structure of the complete self reflects the unity and structure of the social process as a whole;</strong> and each of the elementary selves of which it is composed reflects the unity and structure of one of the various aspects of that process in which the individual is implicated. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>An inability to weave together memories, selves, and the transitions between them leads to a pathological splitting of the personality, to an incoherent biography, to ultimately no biography at all, which would certainly make being in agreement with oneself an evanescent phenomenon. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>My suggestion is that Mead had an undeveloped narratological account of the self that allowed him to make claims that were in line with his rather robust sense of what is right and proper for a human being to achieve, at least in the modern Western world. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Viewing the self in terms of <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> need not challenge Mead’s pluralistic usages of the term self. It complements them by providing an overarching framework that allows us to make sense of how memories and multiple selves are bound together, supplying a unity more comprehensive than the composite social self. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>A very brief reflection.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>The social selves that Mead describes are what I call <a class="ref" href="/topics/weird-fishes">Weird Fishes</a> growing out of role-specific participation in social groups and various types of games or institutions, especially as we come to see our own position from the perspective of others and in the context of the whole "game."</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Those selves would also be the "bearers" of the virtues that MacIntyre calls "internal to practices." The unification or composition of these localized selves into more overarching self-structures is not a given. It's not just a direct consequence of the "unity of consciousness" that analytic philosophers are always proving or disproving. Instead it "reflects the unity and structure of the social process as a whole." I think MacIntyre would basically agree with that.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>It implies that an overall social structure can encourage or hinder the unification of selves. MacIntyre, I think, provides an argument that modernity hinders it and that modern philosophy tends to reflects that. I want to go into that in the future, but for now just this quote will do:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Sartre—I speak now only of the Sartre of the thirties and forties—has depicted the self as entirely distinct from any particular social role which it may happen to assume; Erving Goffman by contrast has liquidated the self into its role-playing, arguing that the self is no more than ‘a peg’ on which the clothes of the role are hung. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section><section><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/jordan-peterson-jonathan-pageau-pastoral-commentary-on-the-second-hour">Jordan Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, Pastoral Commentary on the Second Hour</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-9th-2021">March 9th, 2021</a>.</p><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-9th-2021">March 9th, 2021</a>.</p><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-9th-2021">March 9th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/1-corinthians-6-nasb---lawsuits-discouraged---does-any-one-of-you-when-he-has-a-case-against-his"> 1 Corinthians 6 NASB -

The answer to this question – and the secret to their alliance – was their mutual distrust of identity. Deleuze and Guattari were both resolutely anti-individualist: whether in the realm of politics, psychotherapy or philosophy, they strived to show that the individual was a deception, summoned up to obscure the nature of reality. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>This kind of anti-individualism is not a position <em>against</em> individualism. It's not that we ought to be less self-centered, it's that we aren't individuals at all—not just an ethical claim but an ontological one.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Insofar as we see ourselves as individuals it's because we're participating in a scheme that tries desperately to maintain the paradigm of individuality, which is a struggle against reality, an ideological campaign.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>To escape from that scheme, Foucault's preface to <em>Anti-Oedipus</em> provides a tagline: </p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Free political action from all unitary and totalizing paranoia. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>I think it would be interesting to compare the Deleuzo-Guattarian project with MacIntyre's <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a>.

Guattari saw how the collective will of the Russian Revolution had collapsed into the hierarchical power structure of bureaucratic state communism. Now, he saw the same process occurring in miniature in every group he joined. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>And here, from the book <a class="ref" href="/books/learning-from-macintyre"> Learning From MacIntyre</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>MacIntyre’s key and lasting contribution to New Left literature was to show how “common sense” Kantian responses to the evils of Stalinism were an inadequate basis upon which to rebuild an anti-Stalinist left. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Like Deleuze and Guattari, MacIntyre's project was to find a path beyond both individualism and Stalinism:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>He asked if “there can be an alternative to the barren opposition of moral individualism and amoral Stalinism.” Answering this question in the positive, he claimed that Marxists should follow Aristotle specifically, and the Greeks more generally, in linking ethics to human desires: “we make both individual deeds and social practices intelligible as human actions by showing how they connect with characteristically human desires, needs and the like.” <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>In the cultural reception, I think Deleuze and Guattari are associated with crazy flash-cut postmodernism, frantic accelerationism, rhizomatic hypermedia, incomprehensibility and psychosis, the polar opposite of Aristotelian virtue ethics. The "schizophrenic" aspect of the Deleuzo-Guattarian project projects a very different vibe from MacIntyre's ideal of a coherent polity of local communities.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>But this description of Guattari's practice in working with psychiatric patients suffering from the atomizing individualism of capitalism gives a different picture:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>At La Borde, his techniques included encouraging patients to participate in ‘therapeutic clubs’ for arts and theatre, where they could forge lasting relationships. When trying to give people the tools to reintegrate into society, Guattari said it was necessary to ‘build a new form of subjectivity that no longer relies on the individual.’ <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Deleuze and Guattari, like Marx, see capitalism as a tyranny that nevertheless builds the conditions for the social order that will replace it: communism, that is, a society where work is for the common good. They emphasize <em>desire</em> as a productive force. Capitalism liberates desire from the medieval structures that "melt into air" but also reterritorialize it and privatize it.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>This is also MacIntyre's basic view, as we see clearly in this quote from John Gregson's book about MacIntyre, called <a class="ref" href="/books/marxism-ethics-and-politics"> Marxism, Ethics and Politics</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>MacIntyre argued that capitalism potentially provided a ‘form of life’ through which people could ‘rediscover desire’ in such a way as to discover ‘above all what they want most is what they want in common with others.’. It was this socialized form of desire—the desire to be neither alienated from each other or ones’ self—that could potentially help individuals to discover that what they actually want are new forms of community and radically different social and economic arrangements. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>I'll try to continue this exploration later.</p><div class="indent"></div></div></section><section><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/jordan-peterson-jonathan-pageau-pastoral-commentary-on-the-second-hour">Jordan Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, Pastoral Commentary on the Second Hour</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-8th-2021">March 8th, 2021</a>.</p><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-8th-2021">March 8th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/anarchy-is-not-utopia"> Anarchy Is Not Utopia</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-8th-2021">March 8th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/beyond-order-by-jordan-peterson-review---more-rules-for-life-|-jordan-peterson-|-the-guardian"> Beyond Order by Jordan Peterson Review – More Rules for Life | Jordan Peterson | the Guardian</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-8th-2021">March 8th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/j-leif-no-citizens-abolishing-borders-beyond-the-nation-state"> J.

What it means instead is that you are open. You are a haunted house. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Instead of a single unified top-level self that dominates my mind monarchically, I am a tangled multiplicity of different structures and processes. This is not to say that there's no coherence, no hierarchy, but like <a class="ref" href="/articles/the-government-within"> The Government Within</a> says:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Some people may be organized like monarchies with a strong central self, others may be more anarchic bundles of disparate impulses, others may be flexibly improvising democracies of interest. A kind of mental anarchy is probably the infantile ground state, with structures of governance emerging over time. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Today I'm thinking about this as a way to approach MacIntyre's <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a>, which is not just about what it means to be a good person but also about what it means to be a person at all.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>On the nature of the self, MacIntyre argues against the autonomous & independent agent of the liberal worldview:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>I confront the world as a member of this family, this household, this clan, this tribe, this city, this nation, this kingdom. There is no ‘I’ apart from these. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>You could say it's a historical and material conception of the self. I am an organism that grows embedded in nature and society. There's no reason to assume that I transcend this rootedness. For MacIntyre, this is the origin point of morality:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>I am someone’s son or daughter, someone else’s cousin or uncle; I am a citizen of this or that city, a member of this or that guild or profession; I belong to this clan, that tribe, this nation. Hence what is good for me has to be the good for one who inhabits these roles. As such, I inherit from the past of my family, my city, my tribe, my nation, a variety of debts, inheritances, rightful expectations and obligations. These constitute the given of my life, my moral starting point. This is in part what gives my life its own moral particularity. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>I notice this paragraph has both diversity—<em>this or that city</em>, <em>these roles</em>, <em>a variety of debts</em>—and unity: <em>I</em>, <em>one</em>, <em>me</em>, <em>my life</em>.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Remember the diagram from <a class="ref" href="/articles/hallucinated-gods"> Hallucinated Gods</a> from yesterday:</p><div class="indent"></div><p><a href="/days/march-6th-2021"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fmikaelogy%2FnJNFgHv5c-.png?alt=media&amp;token=2b0dfd97-6340-4da5-a1ba-9adf6f1f16d8"></a></p><div class="indent"></div><p>The diverse elements that make up my life's particularity are "weird fishes" or "ghosts." They are clusters of agency and desire within me. My addictions also give my life moral particularity; my daily need for caffeine is a real structure in my body.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>In fact <em>After Virtue</em> argues at length about the possibility and necessity of seeing a person's self as a unitary entity. This argument is connected to the diversity and unity of virtue.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>A class of weird fish that's particularly thematized in <em>After Virtue</em> is the craft, the community of practice, the productive tradition. Here is where a person first encounters the virtues, and MacIntyre gives a preliminary first definition of virtue as being a quality that allows me to excel internally within a tradition.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>So if I have a passion for woodworking, and I enter into some kind of social tradition of woodworking, then within this part of my life I come to value sturdy and elegant joinery. This doesn't require a unified self. My woodworking passion can be a nexus of agency or a subagent with its own values and virtues.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>And so it's possible that my life and my body would be a rather disjoint assemblage of different passions, addictions, relationships that don't add up to a cohesive meta-agent which unifies all of these structures.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>As a thought experiment, I can imagine having two homes, one in Rīga and one in Stockholm. I would move between them on a weekly basis. In Rīga I speak Latvian, I'm a woodworker, I have a partner and a son. In Stockholm I speak Swedish, I'm a web app developer, and I live alone like a bachelor. My circles of friends are disjoint, I consume different newspapers, etc. I exercise different skills, aim for different goals, my moods and attitudes are different.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Everyone's life is a little bit like this in some ways, and I think it means we need to consider "the self" as a way more complex and dynamic phenomenon than we normally do.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Even when Buddhist meditators talk about the nonexistence of the self, they often seem to conceive the nonexistent self as something that's by default unitary and overarching. But if there's no grand meta-self, how about this ecology of weird fishes? There's still agency, roles, and virtues clustered around identity nexuses.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>I'm not sure what point I am trying to make or whether this all makes sense in an interesting way for anyone reading. But I feel like there's something important about looking at virtues and selfhood like this. Starting with the <em>multiplicity</em> that we're always made up of rather than jumping ahead to cohesive self-identity.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>And I think it's interesting that MacIntyre also has this progression that starts from specific virtues internal to productive traditions and moves up towards virtues that are "genuinely Aristotelian" which means they apply <em>across</em> roles and traditions.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Such virtues are not developed within particular "weird fishes." The virtues that I enact specifically as a woodworker or a web app developer are then supposed to be <em>integrated</em> into higher level virtues. What entity can carry these virtues? The self.</p><div class="indent"></div></div></section><section><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/debt">Debt</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-7th-2021">March 7th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/jordan-peterson-jonathan-pageau-pastoral-commentary-on-the-first-hour">Jordan Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, Pastoral Commentary on the First Hour</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-7th-2021">March 7th, 2021</a>.</p><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-7th-2021">March 7th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/jordan-peterson-jonathan-pageau-pastoral-commentary-on-the-second-hour">Jordan Peterson, Jonathan Pageau, Pastoral Commentary on the Second Hour</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-7th-2021">March 7th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/a-creative-multiplicity"> A Creative Multiplicity</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-7th-2021">March 7th, 2021</a>.</p><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-7th-2021">March 7th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/a-multiple-self-theory-of-the-mind---david-lester-2012"> A Multiple Self Theory of the Mind - David Lester, 2012</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-7th-2021">March 7th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/an-interview-with-jorge-luis-borges-|-commonweal-magazine"> An Interview With Jorge Luis Borges | Commonweal Magazine</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-7th-2021">March 7th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/andras-angyal-a-theoretical-model-for-personality-studies"> Andras Angyal, a Theoretical Model for Personality Studies</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-7th-2021">March 7th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/belief-attachment-and-letting-go"> Belief, Attachment and Letting Go</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-7th-2021">March 7th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/gilles-deleuze-ethics-and-morality"> Gilles Deleuze: Ethics and Morality</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-7th-2021">March 7th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/main-character-energy----real-life"> Main Character Energy — Real Life</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-7th-2021">March 7th, 2021</a>.</p><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-7th-2021">March 7th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/metaphysics-as-a-guide-to-soccer-|-the-point-magazine"> Metaphysics as a Guide to Soccer | the Point Magazine</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-7th-2021">March 7th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/the-year-of-the-birth-of-alberto-caeiro"> The Year of the Birth of Alberto Caeiro</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-7th-2021">March 7th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/object-oriented-philosophy"> Object-Oriented Philosophy</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-7th-2021">March 7th, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article><article><section><h1>March 6th, 2021</h1><h2><strong>Note</strong>: More Weird Fishes: Gods, Languages, Addictions</h2><div class="indent"><p>In yesterday's <a href="/days/march-5th-2021"><strong>Note</strong>: Weird Fishes</a>, I quoted the article <a class="ref" href="/articles/the-government-within"> The Government Within</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>An integrated self, if it is anything, is a construction, an achievement, an emergent fact out of a pre-existing disorder, and one needs to understand this process in order to avoid or correct the pathologies that the process is prone to. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Three salient examples of inner human multiplicity:</p><div class="indent"><p>the <a class="ref" href="/topics/internal-family-systems">Internal Family Systems</a> model of parts;</p><div class="indent"></div><p>the <a class="ref" href="/topics/tulpa">Tulpa</a> phenomenon;

For a monolingual person, the "mother tongue" seems like it would be almost inextricably entangled in the upper level near "the self." Simler writes about single words (like "art"), saying</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>[...] a 'god' or 'spirit' in your brain has a lot more power than any word, because it's alive in there. It's a fully animated concept, with agency of its own. As it happens, words aren't completely dead and lifeless; they're just like little fledgling gods. They can pop to mind unbidden, shift in meaning, and become more or less salient. But they have nowhere near as much intelligence or independent agency as a hallucinated voice. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>But a mother tongue is larger than a word. Indeed the hallucinated voices would typically be "subservient" to that language, in a sense. When Simler compares the Jaynesian gods with "slightly rogue agents" like addictions, the gods are more agentic because they can use language directly. This seems to suggest that language would be even further up the hierarchy than the self and the gods.</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The difference is that, in a typical modern brain, the rogue network exists at a much lower level, whereas the gods in a bicameral brain exist at (more or less) the same level as the self and, crucially, can call upon the language and reasoning faculties directly. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>I know someone who grew up with two languages, Latvian and Russian, and who describes themselves as feeling somewhat split between the two. Each language is associated with one parent: there's a mother tongue and a father tongue, two different cultures, two parts of her self.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Thinking about inner multiplicity like this, it seems natural to also think about the structures associated with projects, interests, and vocations. I am a programmer but also a woodworker. These have their own languages, values, worldviews. They aren't just "roles" in a social sense. They are structurally similar to addictions, gods, or selves.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>My programmer part is an evolution of my general computer-using part. It's quite a core part for me because it flourished and peaked in my adolescence. In some ways it's stuck in adolescence, a kind of "exile" in IFS terms, perpetually 16 years old, wearing a Linux t-shirt and staying up past its bedtime.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>My woodworker part is a form of ancestor worship. It connects to my paternal lineage. In the Jaynesian way of being, it would be associated with a hallucinated ghost of my grandfather. My inner woodworker originates back in some fragmentary memories of tinkering in his basement, but as a living agent now it was born just a couple of years ago.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>In Kaj Sotala's article <a class="ref" href="/articles/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model"> Building Up to an Internal Family Systems Model</a>, he writes:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>I’ve frequently been very dysfunctional, and have always found very intuitive the notion of the mind being split into parts.

To what extent does a good life require long-term commitments and serious projects? And how does that relate to enjoying the present moment?</p><div class="indent"></div><p>In <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a>, this question is most clearly presented in the discussion of <a class="ref" href="/topics/kierkegaard">Kierkegaard</a>'s book <em>Either/Or</em>, which sketches two opposite attitudes to life, labelled the <a class="ref" href="/topics/aesthetic">Aesthetic</a> and the <a class="ref" href="/topics/ethical">Ethical</a>.</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>At the heart of the aesthetic way of life, as Kierkegaard characterizes it, is the attempt to lose the self in the immediacy of present experience. The paradigm of aesthetic expression is the romantic lover who is immersed in his own passion. By contrast the paradigm of the ethical is marriage, a state of commitment and obligation through time, in which the present is bound by the past and to the future. Each of the two ways of life is informed by different concepts, incompatible attitudes, rival premises. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>The interesting thing for MacIntyre is that Kierkegaard's book doesn't try to argue rationally for the superiority of the ethical mode, but instead invokes the necessity of a <a class="ref" href="/topics/radical-choice">Radical Choice</a>, the <a class="ref" href="/topics/leap-of-faith">Leap of Faith</a>. It's not that the two modes are actually equally good, but there's no way of <em>justifying</em> the ethical mode that isn't circular.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>You could try to argue that the ethical mode will lead towards a more pleasant experience, or a more sustainable and healthy pleasure, like a parent saying "if you'll go to sleep now, you'll have more fun tomorrow." But these arguments are quite specious; you'll always have to make these uncertain claims about the future.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>To a person who only values the "immediacy of present experience," it's pointless to argue for the superiority of the ethical mode. This kind of moralism is a perennial source of bitterness, especially between generations, when parents nag their children about renouncing their shallow, fleeting, pleasurable lifestyles and getting serious about work, about politics, about marriage.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>If "the paradigm of the ethical is marriage" then of course the <a class="ref" href="/topics/main-quest">Main Quest</a> of marriage is raising children. Parents are kind of biased, then, towards the ethical mode, and it would be an understatement to say that this has evolutionary implications.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>I've been a parent for nearly two years, and my own ethical orientation is a bit shaky, but I still find myself inhabiting the mindset where my own life is a serious and sacred struggle. I can work myself up to a shaking annoyed frustration just by thinking about the frivolous enjoyment of my childless friends.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>It becomes offensive to me that my brother can just be "immersed in his own passion" all day, especially when he shows less than zero interest in children and views the whole idea of raising a child as a painful lunacy. Formerly interesting friends turn into boring moralizers, withdraw into nuclear family fortresses, and start to insinuate that their lives are more important, more ethical, more real.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>So that becomes the background mood when I cite paragraphs like this:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>A self that does not live into the future, that moves around in a merely playful way in the here and now, and, at best, still lives only from the past, is but momentarily ‘attuned’, not steadily advancing, developing or maturing, is not to borrow a word, an existential self. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>But that's not from a book about ethics, it's from <a class="ref" href="/books/experiences-of-depression"> Experiences of Depression</a>, and I'm interested in it because I'm trying to understand my own life. I've always felt both an urge to engage in projects and a chronic failure to pursue them.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>It's like I can't sit still, even though my projects mostly involve sitting still, and maybe that's one reason why it's only last year that I started considering the possibility that I have <a class="ref" href="/topics/adhd">ADHD</a>. My hyperactivity has never been visible externally, other than in some tics like restless legs, and maybe the fact that when I and my brother started a company we named it <em>Restless</em>.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>This restlessness kind of feels like an intense inner conflict between the <a class="ref" href="/topics/aesthetic">Aesthetic</a> and the <a class="ref" href="/topics/ethical">Ethical</a>, or in the terms of <a href="/days/march-1st-2021"><strong>Note</strong>: Life as Adventure Game</a> a conflict between the <a class="ref" href="/topics/horizontal">Horizontal</a> and the <a class="ref" href="/topics/vertical">Vertical</a>, which then is like a tension between <a class="ref" href="/topics/phenomenology">Phenomenology</a> and <a class="ref" href="/topics/teleology">Teleology</a>.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Such a conflict is implied in this description from <a class="ref" href="/topics/gabor-mate">Gabor Maté</a>'s book <a class="ref" href="/books/scattered-minds"> Scattered Minds</a>:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The adult with ADD is buried under a mound of yeses, many of which are not true yeses at all, only no’s he dared not say. Life is one long exercise in trying to tunnel out from under them, a frustrating task since one keeps adding to the stack faster than one can take away from it. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>In <a href="/days/february-26th-2021"><strong>Note</strong>: Losing the Plot — Ethics and The Big Lebowski</a>, there is the question of the heroism of "the Dude," what makes him such an archetypal character. Remember how he's introduced in the voiceover:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>I won't say a hero, 'cause, what's a hero? But sometimes, there's a man. And I'm talkin' about the Dude here. Sometimes, there's a man, well, he's the man for his time and place. He fits right in there. And that's the Dude, in Los Angeles. And even if he's a lazy man—and the Dude was most certainly that, quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County, which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide. But sometimes there's a man, sometimes, there's a man. Aw. I lost my train of thought here. But... aw, hell. I've done introduced him enough.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>I feel like his <a class="ref" href="/topics/stoner-noir">Stoner Noir</a> heroism lies in the way he approaches the tasks and plots in which he finds himself entangled. They aren't <em>his</em> projects, and he doesn't imbue them with the kind of ethical seriousness that would look down on the lifestyles of others, but he also doesn't "tunnel out from under them."</p><div class="indent"></div><p>It may be that his focus depends on the stern fatherly attunement provided by his veteran friend Walter, whose pathological devotion to the <a class="ref" href="/topics/ethical">Ethical</a> manifests in hilarious obsession with the Sabbath, bowling tournament rules, and revenge. Nevertheless, the Dude abides and keeps his mind limber with a "strict drug regimen" to pursue the "very complicated case." And he seems to enjoy it all.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Kierkegaard did not actually view the ethical mode as superior, but as a desperate stage that one clings to after being disillusioned with the aesthetical mode. Real maturity is another mode: the <a class="ref" href="/topics/religious">Religious</a> mode. </p><div class="indent"></div><p>And religion is quite strange.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>One can easily expect religion to be an even stricter, more serious version of the ethical, where projects and striving are even more rigidly elevated over the frivolous present.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>But you just have to look at <a class="ref" href="/topics/ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</a>.</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Yesterday my brother reminded me of when my friend Ragnar, smoking a cigarette, described his ideal lifestyle as "partying and waiting for the singularity."

There should be a sense that, within the rules of the game world, you can do anything at any time while freely moving about the space.

In drama, <em>acting</em> mostly means <em>talking</em>. But a film narrative is made up of words and actions. In a central paragraph, MacIntyre writes:</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Deprive children of stories and you leave them unscripted, anxious stutterers in their actions as in their words. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>When we act in the world, we are "speaking" within the cultural syntax of intelligible behavior.

Ethical theories like utilitarianism tend to focus on isolated actions, having nothing to say about the narrative structures in which they are intelligible.</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>That particular actions derive their character as parts of larger wholes is a point of view alien to our dominant ways of thinking and yet one which it is necessary at least to consider if we are to begin to understand how a life may be more than a sequence of individual actions and episodes. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>The critical argument of <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a> is that we now generally suffer from a disrupted ability to make sense of our lives as coherent stories within larger common stories.

From his book <a class="ref" href="/books/play-anything"> Play Anything</a>:</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>A playground is a place where play takes place, and play is a practice of manipulating the things you happen to find in a playground. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Play is not only fun, not only a child’s activity, but also exploring the free movement present in a system of any kind, where system might refer to a social situation as much as a machine assembly. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Play entails a paradox: it is an activity of freedom and pleasure and openness and possibility, but it arises from limiting freedoms rather than expanding them. The boundaries of a playground, the contents contained within them. Their structures. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p>Then there's the book <a class="ref" href="/books/experiences-of-depression"> Experiences of Depression</a> by <a class="ref" href="/topics/matthew-ratcliffe">Matthew Ratcliffe</a>, which seems to show <a class="ref" href="/topics/depression">Depression</a> as a phenomenological condition that's in a way the opposite of the playful naïve distinctiveness that I've described as the essential quality of open-world fantasy games.</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>Depression involves a change in the kinds of possibility that are integral to experience, amounting to a diminishment of freedom. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The resultant estrangement from the world amounts to a change in the sense of reality and belonging—things no longer appear available; they are strangely distant, not quite ‘there’ anymore. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>"When you’re depressed, it feels as though there is a huge distance between you and things, which are inert, unresponsive to your wishes. Now that I was feeling better, a pen would leap into my hand, soap seemed to cover me of its own accord, the towel would be in exactly the right place for me to pick it up. Instead of being the slave of the objects around me, I was part again of an active world in which I could participate." <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>"…it was as if the whatness of each thing—I’m no good at philosophical vocabulary—but the essence of each thing in the sense of the tableness of the table or the chairness of the chair or the floorness of the floor was gone. There was a mute and indifferent object in that place. Its availability to human living, to human <a class="ref" href="/topics/dwelling">Dwelling</a> in the world was drained out of it. Its identity as a familiar object that we live with each day was gone. […] the world had lost its welcoming quality. It wasn’t a habitable earth any longer. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p>And then there's <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a>, which is a book about <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> but whose most interesting perspectives to me have to do with the nature of <a class="ref"

class="ref" href="/topics/slate-star-codex">Slate Star Codex</a> </h2><div class="indent"><p>It might seem overblown, but I'm wondering if our Twitter network is doing something like what <a class="ref" href="/topics/alasdair-macintyre">Alasdair MacIntyre</a> describes in the last paragraph of <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a>:</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>What matters at this stage is the construction of local forms of community within which civility and the intellectual and moral life can be sustained through the new dark ages which are already upon us. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p>He's writing part of a world-historical narrative there, and maybe a less grandiloquent formulation would suit better—something like this:</p><div class="indent"><p>**As the old orders of the world reveal themselves as boring, incoherent, and collapsing, what we find ourselves doing is talking among ourselves about how to live well—how to work, how to love, how to think, how to pray, how to <em>maybe</em> take over the world a little bit.**</p><div class="indent"></div></div><p>We are an obscure, nebulous, and nonlocal entity, but it seems right to think of it in this way. We're not exactly ancient <a class="ref" href="/topics/athens">Athens</a>, but we are a kind of republic of letters on the internet, bootstrapping new circuits of virtuous freedom within a decaying old order.</p><div class="indent"><p>It feels funny to use the word "we" in this way. This impulse to inhabit a first-person plural identity feels tribal and dangerous, setting up an ingroup. But it also feels natural, comfortable, and sensible. I don't want to hedge my bets and waffle around; why not just admit that <em>we</em> exist?</p><div class="indent"></div></div><p>The <a class="ref" href="/topics/lesswrong">LessWrong</a> rationalists form a kind of predecessor culture, a buzzing intentional scene that gave birth to a new generation that went off from its utilitarian beehive to journey in the desert as pagan postrationalists.</p><div class="indent"><p>From the <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a> perspective, those rationalists seem like a penultimate evolution of what MacIntyre labels "the Enlightenment project of justifying morality."</p><div class="indent"></div><p>They take <a class="ref" href="/topics/utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a> and bring it up to speed with computation and acceleration, leading to an overwhelming focus on the need to formalize universal morality in order to implant it into the coming superintelligence.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>MacIntyre, on the other hand, is fundamentally critical of both <a class="ref" href="/topics/utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a> and the "deontological" style of ethics that tries to formalize universal moral rules. He historicizes these movements, explains the cultural context in which they seemed inevitable, but deems them failures:</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>I take it then that both the utilitarianism of the middle and late nineteenth century and the analytical moral philosophy of the middle and late twentieth century are alike <strong>unsuccessful attempts to rescue the autonomous moral agent</strong> from the predicament in which the failure of the Enlightenment project of providing him with a secular, rational justification for his moral allegiances had left him. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p>It's not surprising to find distaste for <a class="ref" href="/topics/alasdair-macintyre">Alasdair MacIntyre</a> in this rationalist community, and indeed, as <a class="ref" href="/topics/at-aphercotropist">@aphercotropist</a> has <a href="https://twitter.com/aphercotropist/status/1361104788709023745">pointed out</a>, there are at least three posts on <a class="ref" href="/topics/slate-star-codex">Slate Star Codex</a> denouncing <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a> as not only wrong and impractical but nonsensical.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>The first anti-MacIntyre post on Slate Star Codex is <a class="ref" href="/articles/book-review-after-virtue"> Book Review: After Virtue</a>.</p><div class="indent"><p>Alexander is committed to <a class="ref" href="/topics/utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a> as the only useful moral theory.</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>I propose as the solution some form of utilitarianism, the only moral theory in which everything is commensurable and so <strong>there exists a single determinable standard</strong> for deciding among different moral claims. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p>Deontology is incorrect and harmful, but to quote <a class="ref" href="/topics/the-big-lebowski">The Big Lebowski</a>, at least it's an <em>ethos</em>:</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>I don’t like deontology. In fact, I dislike it more than almost anyone I know except maybe Federico. But I will give credit where credit is due: deontology actually comes up with solutions to moral problems. <strong>The solutions are wildly incorrect and incredibly harmful, but they get a gold star for effort.</strong> <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p><a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a>, on the other hand, cannot even attempt to solve any moral dilemmas.</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>In the entire book, MacIntyre doesn’t give a single example of virtue ethics being used to solve a moral dilemma, as indeed it cannot be. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p><a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a> seems like <em>nonsense</em> to him; he can't understand MacIntyre's reputation as a philosopher.</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>But the thing is that MacIntyre is considered one of the greatest living philosophers, and <em>After Virtue</em> one of the century’s greatest works on ethics. Just on priors I’m more likely to be misunderstanding him than he is to be talking nonsense. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></div><p>The second anti-MacIntyre post on Slate Star Codex is <a class="ref" href="/articles/virtue-ethics-not-practically-useful-either"> Virtue Ethics: Not Practically Useful, Either</a>.</p><div class="indent"><p><a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> doesn't seem to describe how Scott Alexander experiences moral decisions. It seems irrelevant to how morality actually works in his case.</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>My experience of morality is contrary to traditional virtue ethics in almost every way. It doesn’t feel like it depends on my social roles. It doesn’t strike me as divisible – that is, it feels like solid goodness and words like “continence” or “prudence” don’t do anything to me. It doesn’t strike me as the same feeling that occurs when I consider important but non-ethical questions like procrastination. It doesn’t strike me as performed in a community or according to a narrative. It’s just not virtue ethics. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p>As for practices that might improve one's moral behavior, he considers different flavors with different outcomes, and predicts that contemplating virtue ethics will lead to a bad outcome: involvement in local politics (useless) rather than Third World charity (useful).</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>I bet reading works of fiction about poor people in the Third World would make you more likely to donate to charity, and contemplating virtue ethics and the just <em>polis</em> would make you more likely to make you get involved in local politics. Which of these you recommend is very closely linked to whether you think giving to charity to the Third World is more or less important than getting involved in local politics (hint: there is only one answer to this question which is not really stupid). <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p>There are practices that improve morality, but they are entirely outside of the schemes that he takes <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a> to promote, and the best one is <a class="ref" href="/topics/meditation">Meditation</a>.</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>In terms of the best all-around practice for increasing morality I would nominate meditation, especially lovingkindness meditation. <a class="ref" href="/topics/david-chapman">David Chapman</a>, who knows ten zillion times more about Buddhism and meditation than I do, suggests <em>metta bhavana</em>, <em>tonglen</em>, and <em>chöd</em>. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></div><p>The third anti-MacIntyre post on Slate Star Codex is <a class="ref" href="/articles/last-thoughts-on-virtue-ethics"> Last Thoughts on Virtue Ethics</a>.</p><div class="indent"><p>If <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue-ethics">virtue ethics</a> is just about using one's "intuitive morality" instead of thinking rationally, then we don't get anywhere. All we can do is habitually do the good that everyone already knows is good. There's no room for improvement and no way to solve dilemmas.</p><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>We can use our intuitive morality to determine we should not go around murdering little kids for no reason. This is good. But as a consequence, <em>no one is remotely interested in the question of whether we should go around murdering little kids for no reason</em>. No one goes to moral philosophers to ask that question. The very fact that it is solvable by intuitive ethics means that it is <em>a solved problem</em>. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p>I wouldn't argue with Scott Alexander's point that <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a> fails to provide a clear and actionable principle for determining the correct solutions to moral dilemmas. </p><div class="indent"><p>I might quibble that his utilitarianism leaves as an exercise to the reader how <em>exactly</em> to work out the "single determinable standard," an exercise that is in fact fundamentally impossible, hence why utilitarianism has been around for 300 years without actually solving morality.</p><div class="indent"></div></div><p>But the strength of this conflict seems to confirm that there's something to my hunch that <a class="ref" href="/books/after-virtue"> After Virtue</a> is relevant for understanding this fledgling community's exodus from <a class="ref" href="/topics/rationalism">Rationalism</a>.</p><div class="indent"></div></div><p>I started with a quote about the contemporary need for "construction of new forms of community" from the book's last page. Earlier, there's another paragraph expressing how that took place in the late period of the Roman empire:</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>A crucial turning point in that earlier history occurred when men and women of good will turned aside from the task of shoring up the Roman <em>imperium</em> and ceased to identify the continuation of civility and moral community with the maintenance of that <em>imperium</em>. What they set themselves to achieve instead—often not recognizing fully what they were doing—was the construction of new forms of community within which the moral life could be sustained so that both morality and civility might survive the coming ages of barbarism and darkness. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p>That's all I have time to write today.

I can just import those, and then tomorrow I can synthesize them into a notebook post, using the great feedback I got from @sashachapin.</a></p><div class="indent"></div></div><p>Alright then—here are my drafts. You can read them if you want, but they're mostly here for me to use as source material.</p><div class="indent"><p><a class="ref" href="/topics/gendlin-and-alexander-number-draft-1">Gendlin and Alexander: #Draft 1</a></p><div class="indent"></div><p><a class="ref" href="/topics/gendlin-and-alexander-number-draft-2">Gendlin and Alexander: #Draft 2</a></p><div class="indent"></div><p><a class="ref" href="/topics/gendlin-and-alexander-number-draft-3">Gendlin and Alexander: #Draft 3</a></p><div class="indent"></div></div><p>What now? How do I take three different takes on a subject and compose a synthesis of them? I feel like I've already spent my time, effort, and caring budget on this project.</p><div class="indent"><p>It's actually a bit annoying that I <em>care</em> so much about this vague connection between two thinkers, while it also feels like hard work to draw out the resemblance.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>That's also because both thinkers are a bit... mysterious? There's a kind of nausea I get when I write about this thing. The whole theme seems so precious, subtle, and possibly pretentious.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>I have a feeling that no matter how much I write, I'll never get to the bottom of the thing, only scratch the surface aimlessly, and so all the text I produce amounts to nothing—but this is pessimistic.</p><div class="indent"><p>In fact, as <a class="ref" href="/topics/at-sashachapin">@sashachapin</a> affirms coachingly, I've been a very good boy writing all these drafts, and quickly too.</p><div class="indent"></div></div></div><p>Another problem is that I don't know what to call the thing I'm trying to write about.</p><div class="indent"><p>So far my only handle on it is "the thing that Gendlin and Alexander seem to have in common somehow."</p><div class="indent"></div><p>I was attuned to this problem when I wrote the first draft.</p><div class="indent"><p><a href="/topics/gendlin-and-alexander-number-draft-1">Maybe what I’m doing now is trying to orient myself around a certain nameless sense of similarity between these two authors, as if they are both pointing towards something nebulous yet distinct which I can’t yet name.</a></p><div class="indent"></div><p><a href="/topics/gendlin-and-alexander-number-draft-1">Now, I’ll try to put the nameless thing in front of me. Instead of being sucked into it with an urgent anxious <em>need</em> to understand it, I can let it be there as it is, and only then can I start to probe it, relate to it, feel it out.</a></p><div class="indent"></div><p>My solution then was to step back and use my imagination to create a scene of these two men meeting each other.</p><div class="indent"><p><a href="/topics/gendlin-and-alexander-number-draft-1">It seems to me that they would enjoy each other’s company. They both have a warmness, but combined with a kind of grandfatherly severity, a seriousness of purpose. They see a world that’s torn apart and made ugly by humanity’s ruptured attunement, modernity’s reductive analysis, the imposition of Patterns that fail to cohere and heal. And they have both spent decades developing practices that seem to border on the mystical, outside of mainstream practice, compelled to admit that they have discovered something vital and wholesome and forgotten.</a></p><div class="indent"></div></div></div><p>Well, so—I don't know what to call the thing? That's an appropriate problem, a problem that's the beating hidden heart of Gendlin's and Alexander's work: how can we address the nameless felt senses that pervade our lives?</p><div class="indent"></div><p>In my second draft, I wrote this effusive paragraph:</p><div class="indent"><p><a href="/topics/gendlin-and-alexander-number-draft-2">Artists have to do this kind of thing all the time. Writing is also suffused with it. There’s something I’m trying to resolve, some problem I perceive not just as a logical puzzle but as a murky hopeful confusion in my whole being. I can’t just look at it and take notes as if I were examining a train schedule. I have to orbit around it and let it affect me. I have to allow my own confusion as I rub against the thing to make sparks. Often nothing happens, my proud ambition runs up against a wall of cold despair, the glowing nexus of fascination I had felt seems like a mirage. Words fail to make contact with the alien entity that flits around in the outer atmosphere of my intellect making scintillating noises of obscure significance.</a></p><div class="indent"></div></div><p>Gendlin offers consolation to my own project:</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>Suppose you are interviewing a rather shy person who hasn’t been allowed to say much for some time, perhaps some years. You would not get impatient and yell at the person after five seconds. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></div><p>There's a few different strands of this project:</p><div class="indent"><p>describing <a class="ref" href="/topics/eugene-gendlin">Eugene Gendlin</a>'s <a class="ref" href="/books/focusing"> Focusing</a>;</p><div class="indent"></div><p>describing <a class="ref" href="/topics/christopher-alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>'s architectural practice;</p><div class="indent"></div><p>describing <a class="ref" href="/topics/christopher-alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>'s wider aesthetic theory;</p><div class="indent"></div><p>showing how Alexander's approach involves the same kind of attunement that Gendlin's method teaches;</p><div class="indent"></div><p>exploring both thinkers' critiques of modernity; and</p><div class="indent"></div><p>exploring what I think of as the "positive <a class="ref" href="/topics/teleology">Teleology</a>" of these practices.</p><div class="indent"></div></div><p>I think this last point might be the most interesting. What does it mean?</p><div class="indent"><p>For Gendlin, the purpose of <a class="ref" href="/books/focusing"> Focusing</a> is not just to learn an interesting way to address and describe phenomena. The purpose is <em>therapeutic</em>, which means it aims at <em>health</em>. Not only that, but the method aims to show how the body is already attuned towards health, rightness, life.</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>It knows the direction. It knows this just as surely as you know which way to move a crooked picture. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p><a href="/topics/gendlin-and-alexander-number-draft-2">The body has intentions and desires. In a broad and general sense, it wants to go somewhere. It wants to set things straight. It has a directionality, some rudimentary Telos, an urge to cohere, persist, and flourish. Therapy ought to assist this innate yearning rather than impose some external schema. We need to learn to listen to our own perceptions.</a></p><div class="indent"></div><p>Alexander’s practice revolves around moving things around until something clicks, until tensions are resolved and the body feels that the environment is becoming better, more joyful, more free. His work is building but he thinks of it as fundamentally a process of “repairing” the world, iteratively healing the site with <a class="ref" href="/topics/structure-preserving-transformation">Structure-Preserving Transformation</a>s that enhance its wholeness.</p><div class="indent"><p>(I mentioned this yesterday: <a href="/days/february-22nd-2021">Deep Laziness, Structure-Preserving Transformations, and Elaborated Time</a>.)</p><div class="indent"></div></div><p>So this is the theme I felt happiest to discover while writing these drafts, and the one that seems to <em>point</em>, to indicate a <em>path</em>.</p><div class="indent"><p>With Gendlin, we learn to look in, toward the <a class="ref" href="/topics/felt-sense">Felt Sense</a> of the body, untangling inner knots and understanding ourselves.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>With Alexander, we learn to look out, toward the environment, enhancing outer <a class="ref" href="/topics/centers">Centers</a> and improving the world.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Both point in "the direction of healing and life <a class="cite" href="#">*</a>".</p><div class="indent"></div></div><p>Alexander's fundamental concern is about relearning how to create living structure, how to stop making a world that's ugly and dead, so the future can be alive.</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>To create living structure in the environment of our age, and in the future age which stretches before us, we must now find ways of turning society beyond its too-regimented path, and towards paths of design and planning and construction which allow the life of every whole and the life of every part to emerge freely from the processes by which we make the world.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p>The last section of Gendlin's book <a class="ref" href="/books/focusing"> Focusing</a> shows a similar hope, beyond the individual's private psychological healing:</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>Our structured institutions today offer little opportunity for personal living and speaking. The real living of people is mostly dulled and silent, inside them, alone [...] Focusing is only a piece of an answer. It lets people find their own inner source of direction. It can be a source of new <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>s, devised freshly by each individual [...] A society of <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>-makers is coming. It cannot help but be a society in which people are also more sensitive to, and intolerant of, social brutalities and oppressions, and more able to act to change them.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></div><p>I feel like I can leave this project for now.</p><div class="indent"><p>I've done what I can to sketch some outlines for what I think is not just a single cohesive article but more like a research program.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>It's not like I'm moving on from Gendlin and Alexander; they'll always be part of my thinking and writing, in one way or another.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>I didn't manage to craft an article to publish, but I did a lot of writing.</p><div class="indent"></div></div></div></section><section><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/readwise">Readwise</a></h3><div><p>On <a class="ref" href="/days/february-23rd-2021">February 23rd, 2021</a> at 9:50 AM Readwise synced 23 highlights from 3 books.</p><p>On <a class="ref" href="/days/february-23rd-2021">February 23rd, 2021</a> at 10:50 AM Readwise synced 17 highlights from 2 books.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/american-idle----remains-of-the-day"> American Idle — Remains of the Day</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/february-23rd-2021">February 23rd, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/awareness-is-a-user-interface-|-expanding-awareness-number-16"> Awareness Is a User Interface | Expanding Awareness #16</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/february-23rd-2021">February 23rd, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/how-twitter-got-its-groove-back"> How Twitter Got Its Groove Back</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/february-23rd-2021">February 23rd, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/articles/inexhaustible-precision"> Inexhaustible Precision</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/february-23rd-2021">February 23rd, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/books/the-book-of-disquiet"> The Book of Disquiet</a></h3><div><p>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/february-23rd-2021">February 23rd, 2021</a>.</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article><article><section><h1>February 22nd, 2021</h1><h2><strong>Note</strong>: Starting a Public Notebook</h2><div class="indent"><h3>Introduction</h3><div class="indent"><p>Hey, I'm <a class="ref" href="/topics/at-meekaale">@meekaale</a> from Twitter.

I need a practice that's forgiving, relaxed, enjoyable, while still encouraging me to write and publish.

I can do my writing as part of what Perry calls <a class="ref" href="/topics/elaborated-time">Elaborated Time</a>:</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>Elaborated time is reached in easy steps, a natural progression arising from each particular context.

I feel encouraged to nest more deeply than I would with sections, and this seems like an improvement on conventional article formatting.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>It makes a lot of sense as a drafting structure, and maybe this notebook is actually a kind of public draft workshop.</p><div class="indent"></div></div></div><p>I would normally judge the quality of private journaling and public writing in very different ways. </p><div class="indent"><p>In my private journal, there's almost no concern with legibility, keeping the reader's attention, and such writerly qualities; it's just a second brain for my own use. </p><div class="indent"><p>In an article, those concerns are paramount and perfectionistic. </p><div class="indent"></div></div><p>But in this Roam notebook, I feel attuned to a different vibe, a middle way.</p><div class="indent"></div></div><p>Roam really started to unlock new levels of generativity for me when I realized I can automatically get all my highlights from Kindle and Instapaper imported automatically via <a class="ref" href="/topics/readwise">Readwise</a>.</p><div class="indent"><p>All the highlights I've made casually over the years are now suddenly available with fantastic ease to reference on the fly while writing.</p><div class="indent"></div><p>Since the day I found this pipeline, I've started to read books in a different way, with a primary focus on identifying good highlights to bring into my graph.</p><div class="indent"></div></div><p>And so I've already been privately doing what <a class="ref" href="/articles/a-guide-to-starting-a-daily-writing-practice"> A Guide to Starting a Daily Writing Practice</a> recommends:</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>My favourite prompt is to find some interesting passage of writing, copy it out, and add commentary. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p>One benefit of the daily writing practice, according to MacIver, is that </p><div class="indent"><blockquote>by writing daily you’ll start to notice themes across your writing, and you can begin to draw them out, connecting up your knowledge and thoughts better. <a class="cite" href="#">*</a></blockquote><div class="indent"></div><p>Needless to say, this is the essence of Roam.</p><div class="indent"></div></div></div><h3>What I'll Write About</h3><div class="indent"><p>The article I've been trying to write is about drawing connections between <a class="ref" href="/topics/eugene-gendlin">Eugene Gendlin</a> and <a class="ref" href="/topics/christopher-alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>.</p><div class="indent"><p>Can I keep my intention to compose a decent article about that topic, while also shifting towards writing in this notebook?</p><div class="indent"><p>Well, I've got three different drafts already.
