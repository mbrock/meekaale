There is nothing to suggest that this trend will not continue.â€™</blockquote><blockquote id="swX1X5oNB">Almost every year the United Nations admits new members. And many â€˜old nations,â€™ once thought fully consolidated, find themselves challenged by â€˜subâ€™-nationalisms within their borders â€“ nationalisms which, naturally, dream of shedding this sub-ness one happy day.</blockquote><blockquote id="L052spal8">The reality is quite plain: the â€˜end of the era of nationalism,â€™ so long prophesied, is not remotely in sight. Indeed, nation-ness is the most universally legitimate value in the political life of our time.</blockquote><blockquote id="5qTpzJVRg">My point of departure is that nationality, or, as one might prefer to put it in view of that wordâ€™s multiple significations, nation-ness, as well as nationalism, are cultural artefacts of a particular kind.</blockquote><blockquote id="lWWAQTr4t">I will be trying to argue that the creation of these artefacts towards the end of the eighteenth century7 was the spontaneous distillation of a complex â€˜crossingâ€™ of discrete historical forces; but that, once created, they became â€˜modular,â€™ capable of being transplanted, with varying degrees of self-consciousness, to a great variety of social terrains, to merge and be merged with a correspondingly wide variety of political and ideological constellations.</blockquote><blockquote id="Hf6FA8bKk">In an anthropological spirit, then, I propose the following definition of the nation: it is an imagined political community â€“ and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="e_xXsrv7G">It is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion.</blockquote><blockquote id="x72VTp7Ky">The nation is imagined as limited because even the largest of them, encompassing perhaps a billion living human beings, has finite, if elastic, boundaries, beyond which lie other nations. No nation imagines itself coterminous with mankind. The most messianic nationalists do not dream of a day when all the members of the human race will join their nation in the way that it was possible, in certain epochs, for, say, Christians to dream of a wholly Christian planet.</blockquote><blockquote id="pIZCbPOzG">It is imagined as sovereign because the concept was born in an age in which Enlightenment and Revolution were destroying the legitimacy of the divinely-ordained, hierarchical dynastic realm. Coming to maturity at a stage of human history when even the most devout adherents of any universal religion were inescapably confronted with the living pluralism of such religions, and the allomorphism between each faithâ€™s ontological claims and territorial stretch, nations dream of being free, and, if under God, directly so. The gage and emblem of this freedom is the sovereign state.</blockquote><blockquote id="wRG1bN83z">Finally, it is imagined as a community, because, regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship.</blockquote><blockquote id="7PA3d1lAH">The century of the Enlightenment, of rationalist secularism, brought with it its own modern darkness. With the ebbing of religious belief, the suffering which belief in part composed did not disappear. Disintegration of paradise: nothing makes fatality more arbitrary. Absurdity of salvation: nothing makes another style of continuity more necessary. What then was required was a secular transformation of fatality into continuity, contingency into meaning. As we shall see, few things were (are) better suited to this end than an idea of nation.</blockquote><blockquote id="FF98qo5Gj">All the great classical communities conceived of themselves as cosmically central, through the medium of a sacred language linked to a superterrestrial order of power.</blockquote><blockquote id="EdlRQ7LWp">Yet if the sacred silent languages were the media through which the great global communities of the past were imagined, the reality of such apparitions depended on an idea largely foreign to the contemporary Western mind: the non-arbitrariness of the sign. The ideograms of Chinese, Latin, or Arabic were emanations of reality, not randomly fabricated representations of it.</blockquote><blockquote id="SVf1JHqoD">In effect, ontological reality is apprehensible only through a single, privileged system of re-presentation: the truth-language of Church Latin, Qurâ€™anic Arabic, or Examination Chinese.</blockquote><blockquote id="JtdrhT32k">A fuller explanation requires a glance at the relationship between the literati and their societies. It would be a mistake to view the former as a kind of theological technocracy. The languages they sustained, if abstruse, had none of the self-arranged abstruseness of lawyersâ€™ or economistsâ€™ jargons, on the margin of societyâ€™s idea of reality. Rather, the literati were adepts, strategic strata in a cosmological hierarchy of which the apex was divine.</blockquote><blockquote id="bq6Z71IJS">The fundamental conceptions about â€˜social groupsâ€™ were centripetal and hierarchical, rather than boundary-oriented and horizontal. The astonishing power of the papacy in its noonday is only comprehensible in terms of a trans-European Latin-writing clerisy, and a conception of the world, shared by virtually everyone, that the bilingual intelligentsia, by mediating between vernacular and Latin, mediated between earth and heaven.</blockquote><blockquote id="DDgInjUHz">In a word, the fall of Latin exemplified a larger process in which the sacred communities integrated by old sacred languages were gradually fragmented, pluralized, and territorialized.</blockquote><blockquote id="TtRYBRBvu">Kingship organizes everything around a high centre. Its legitimacy derives from divinity, not from populations, who, after all, are subjects, not citizens.</blockquote><blockquote id="IZA5JynHY">In the modern conception, state sovereignty is fully, flatly, and evenly operative over each square centimetre of a legally demarcated territory. But in the older imagining, where states were defined by centres, borders were porous and indistinct, and sovereignties faded imperceptibly into one another.</blockquote><blockquote id="1tKunhb23">Beneath the decline of sacred communities, languages and lineages, a fundamental change was taking place in modes of apprehending the world, which, more than anything else, made it possible to â€˜thinkâ€™ the nation.</blockquote><blockquote id="rnNq9gveV">Our own conception of simultaneity has been a long time in the making, and its emergence is certainly connected, in ways that have yet to be well studied, with the development of the secular sciences. But it is a conception of such fundamental importance that, without taking it fully into account, we will find it difficult to probe the obscure genesis of nationalism. What has come to take the place of the mediaeval conception of simultaneity-along-time is, to borrow again from Benjamin, an idea of â€˜homogeneous, empty time,â€™ in which simultaneity is, as it were, transverse, cross-time, marked not by prefiguring and fulfilment, but by temporal coincidence, and measured by clock and calendar.</blockquote><blockquote id="Gy28APacc">Consider first the structure of the old-fashioned novel, a structure typical not only of the masterpieces of Balzac but also of any contemporary dollar-dreadful. It is clearly a device for the presentation of simultaneity in â€˜homogeneous, empty time,â€™ or a complex gloss upon the word â€˜meanwhileâ€™.</blockquote><blockquote id="6LgXnHwZD">The idea of a sociological organism moving calendrically through homogeneous, empty time is a precise analogue of the idea of the nation, which also is conceived as a solid community moving steadily down (or up) history.</blockquote><blockquote id="GwhC4Iv3M">An American will never meet, or even know the names of more than a handful of his 240,000,000-odd fellow-Americans. He has no idea of what they are up to at any one time. But he has complete confidence in their steady, anonymous, simultaneous activity.</blockquote><blockquote id="W88bICndF">What is the essential literary convention of the newspaper? If we were to look at a sample front page of, say, The New York Times, we might find there stories about Soviet dissidents, famine in Mali, a gruesome murder, a coup in Iraq, the discovery of a rare fossil in Zimbabwe, and a speech by Mitterrand. Why are these events so juxtaposed? What connects them to each other?</blockquote><blockquote id="e6cwQyb0e">The date at the top of the newspaper, the single most important emblem on it, provides the essential connection â€“ the steady onward clocking of homogeneous, empty time.54 Within that time, â€˜the worldâ€™ ambles sturdily ahead.</blockquote><blockquote id="MLdd3GU1k">The novelistic format of the newspaper assures them that somewhere out there the â€˜characterâ€™ Mali moves along quietly, awaiting its next reappearance in the plot.</blockquote><blockquote id="Ni2vjPIhI">The obsolescence of the newspaper on the morrow of its printing â€“ curious that one of the earlier mass-produced commodities should so prefigure the inbuilt obsolescence of modern durables â€“ nonetheless, for just this reason, creates this extraordinary mass ceremony: the almost precisely simultaneous consumption (â€˜imaginingâ€™) of the newspaper-as-fiction.</blockquote><blockquote id="yOaYry6Ff">The significance of this mass ceremony â€“ Hegel observed that newspapers serve modern man as a substitute for morning prayers â€“ is paradoxical. It is performed in silent privacy, in the lair of the skull.62 Yet each communicant is well aware that the ceremony he performs is being replicated simultaneously by thousands (or millions) of others of whose existence he is confident, yet of whose identity he has not the slightest notion. Furthermore, this ceremony is incessantly repeated at daily or half-daily intervals throughout the calendar. What more vivid figure for the secular, historically clocked, imagined community can be envisioned?</blockquote><blockquote id="cMOK71G4P">Reading a newspaper is like reading a novel whose author has abandoned any thought of a coherent plot.</blockquote><blockquote id="zxQQIToK-">Before the age of print, Rome easily won every war against heresy in Western Europe because it always had better internal lines of communication than its challengers. But when in 1517 Martin Luther nailed his theses to the chapel-door in Wittenberg, they were printed up in German translation, and â€˜within 15 days [had been] seen in every part of the country.â€™</blockquote><blockquote id="Umg5tkjmq">Where Luther led, others quickly followed, opening the colossal religious propaganda war that raged across Europe for the next century. In this titanic â€˜battle for menâ€™s mindsâ€™, Protestantism was always fundamentally on the offensive, precisely because it knew how to make use of the expanding vernacular print-market being created by capitalism, while the Counter-Reformation defended the citadel of Latin.</blockquote><blockquote id="rw52Pc_Jn">In effect, the political fragmentation of Western Europe after the collapse of the Western Empire meant that no sovereign could monopolize Latin and make it his-and-only-his language-of-state, and thus Latinâ€™s religious authority never had a true political analogue.</blockquote><blockquote id="49UuOQYXW">These print-languages laid the bases for national consciousnesses in three distinct ways. First and foremost, they created unified fields of exchange and communication below Latin and above the spoken vernaculars.</blockquote><blockquote id="VEcX5ifxE">These fellow-readers, to whom they were connected through print, formed, in their secular, particular, visible invisibility, the embryo of the nationally imagined community.</blockquote><blockquote id="MX0KMrcE9">We still have no giant multinationals in the world of publishing.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
