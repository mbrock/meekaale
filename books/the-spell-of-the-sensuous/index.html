Every sound was a voice, every scrape or blunder was a meeting‚Äîwith Thunder, with Oak, with Dragonfly. And from all of these relationships our collective sensibilities were nourished.</blockquote><blockquote id="YwmNXKMPr">Today we participate almost exclusively with other humans and with our own human-made technologies. It is a precarious situation, given our age-old reciprocity with the many-voiced landscape. We still need that which is other than ourselves and our own creations. The simple premise of this book is that we are human only in contact, and conviviality, with what is not human.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="LP0ghkcmQ">For the magician‚Äôs intelligence is not encompassed within the society; its place is at the edge of the community, mediating between the human community and the larger community of beings upon which the village depends for its nourishment and sustenance.</blockquote><blockquote id="auRAZzlrY">The medicine person‚Äôs primary allegiance, then, is not to the human community, but to the earthly web of relations in which that community is embedded‚Äîit is from this that his or her power to alleviate human illness derives‚Äîand this sets the local magician apart from other persons.</blockquote><blockquote id="fY4sRusVU">The most sophisticated definition of ‚Äúmagic‚Äù that now circulates through the American counterculture is ‚Äúthe ability or power to alter one‚Äôs consciousness at will.‚Äù No mention is made of any reason for altering one‚Äôs consciousness. Yet in tribal cultures that which we call ‚Äúmagic‚Äù takes its meaning from the fact that humans, in an indigenous and oral context, experience their own consciousness as simply one form of awareness among many others.</blockquote><blockquote id="hWca5Ln4a">It is this, we might say, that defines a shaman: the ability to readily slip out of the perceptual boundaries that demarcate his or her particular culture‚Äîboundaries reinforced by social customs, taboos, and most importantly, the common speech or language‚Äîin order to make contact with, and learn from, the other powers in the land.</blockquote><blockquote id="D6dey2s0f">It is not by sending his awareness out beyond the natural world that the shaman makes contact with the purveyors of life and health, nor by journeying into his personal psyche; rather, it is by propelling his awareness laterally, outward into the depths of a landscape at once both sensuous and psychological, the living dream that we share with the soaring hawk, the spider, and the stone silently sprouting lichens on its coarse surface.</blockquote><blockquote id="yq2tz6TQJ">Our strictly human heavens and hells have only recently been abstracted from the sensuous world that surrounds us, from this more-than-human realm that abounds in its own winged intelligences and cloven-hoofed powers. For almost all oral cultures, the enveloping and sensuous earth remains the dwelling place of both the living and the dead.</blockquote><blockquote id="9fXm_-M2W">Caught up in a mass of abstractions, our attention hypnotized by a host of human-made technologies that only reflect us back to ourselves, it is all too easy for us to forget our carnal inherence in a more-than-human matrix of sensations and sensibilities.</blockquote><blockquote id="ajeqBnk-e">To shut ourselves off from these other voices, to continue by our lifestyles to condemn these other sensibilities to the oblivion of extinction, is to rob our own senses of their integrity, and to rob our <a class="ref" href="/topics/mind">Mind</a>s of their coherence. We are human only in contact, and conviviality, with what is not human.</blockquote><blockquote id="y5TRDiGwG">Intermittently, I began to wonder if my culture‚Äôs assumptions regarding the lack of awareness in other animals and in the land itself was less a product of careful and judicious reasoning than of a strange inability to clearly perceive other animals‚Äîa real inability to clearly see, or focus upon, anything outside the realm of human technology, or to hear as meaningful anything other than human speech.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="RxsdXlCn2">But perhaps we may make our stand along the edge of that civilization, like a magician, or like a person who, having lived among another tribe, can no longer wholly return to his own.</blockquote><blockquote id="bfHKhqb4_">Indeed, the ostensibly ‚Äúvalue-free‚Äù results of our culture‚Äôs investigations into biology, physics, and chemistry ultimately come to display themselves in the open and uncertain field of everyday life, whether embedded in social policies with which we must come to terms or embodied in new technologies with which we all must grapple. Thus, the living world‚Äîthis ambiguous realm that we experience in anger and joy, in grief and in love‚Äîis both the soil in which all our sciences are rooted and the rich humus into which their results ultimately return, whether as nutrients or as poisons.</blockquote><blockquote id="aF4InzkgC">The fluid realm of direct experience has come to be seen as a secondary, derivative dimension, a mere consequence of events unfolding in the ‚Äúrealer‚Äù world of quantifiable and measurable scientific ‚Äúfacts.‚Äù It is a curious inversion of the actual, demonstrable state of affairs.</blockquote><blockquote id="OqK5LeGPX">All my knowledge of the world, even my scientific knowledge, is gained from my own particular point of view, or from some experience of the world without which the symbols of science would be meaningless. The whole universe of science is built upon the world as directly experienced, and if we want to subject science itself to rigorous scrutiny and arrive at a precise assessment of its meaning and scope, we must begin by reawakening the basic experience of the world, of which science is the second-order expression.‚Ä¶ To return to things themselves is to return to that world which precedes knowledge, of which knowledge always speaks, and in relation to which every scientific schematization is an abstract and derivative sign-language, as is geography in relation to the countryside in which we have learnt beforehand what a forest, a prairie or a river is.</blockquote><blockquote id="7ja74yAv4">The striving for objectivity is thus understood, phenomenologically, as a striving to achieve greater consensus, greater agreement or consonance among a plurality of subjects, rather than as an attempt to avoid subjectivity altogether. The pure ‚Äúobjective reality‚Äù commonly assumed by modern science, far from being the concrete basis underlying all experience, was, according to Husserl, a theoretical construction, an unwarranted idealization of intersubjective experience.</blockquote><blockquote id="MsvmOd1Zz">It was Husserl‚Äôs genius to realize that the assumption of objectivity had led to an almost total eclipse of the life-world in the modern era, to a nearly complete forgetting of this living dimension in which all of our endeavors are rooted. In their striving to attain a finished blueprint of the world, the sciences had become frightfully estranged from our direct human experience.</blockquote><blockquote id="HaWj_zbly">(Descartes‚Äôs philosophical disjunction of the mind from the body was surely prompted by this already existing state of affairs‚Äîit was necessary, for the maintenance of the new, Copernican worldview, that the rational intellect hold itself apart from the experiencing body.)</blockquote><blockquote id="HFCFbi7r2">For Merleau-Ponty, all of the creativity and free-ranging mobility that we have come to associate with the human intellect is, in truth, an elaboration, or recapitulation, of a profound creativity already underway at the most immediate level of sensory perception. The</blockquote><blockquote id="379WsHGZv">By asserting that perception, phenomenologically considered, is inherently participatory, we mean that perception always involves, at its most intimate level, the experience of an active interplay, or coupling, between the perceiving body and that which it perceives.</blockquote><blockquote id="R1V-IbMia">Synaesthetic perception is the rule, and we are unaware of it only because scientific knowledge shifts the center of gravity of experience, so that we have unlearned how to see, hear, and generally speaking, feel, in order to deduce, from our bodily organization and the world as the physicist conceives it, what we are to see, hear, and feel.</blockquote><blockquote id="4DupSAHxi">My various senses, diverging as they do from a single, coherent body, coherently converge, as well, in the perceived thing, just as the separate perspectives of my two eyes converge upon the raven and convene there into a single focus.</blockquote><blockquote id="qbYQIwuyk">Even an ant crawling along my arm, visible to my eyes and tactile to my skin, displays at the same time its own sentience, responding immediately to my movements, even to the chemical changes of my mood. In relation to the ant I feel myself as a dense and material object, as capricious in my actions as the undulating earth itself.</blockquote><blockquote id="gMmbk1k99">To touch the coarse skin of a tree is thus, at the same time, to experience one‚Äôs own tactility, to feel oneself touched by the tree.</blockquote><blockquote id="PUNr8BANv">We can perceive things at all only because we ourselves are entirely a part of the sensible world that we perceive! We might as well say that we are organs of this world, flesh of its flesh, and that the world is perceiving itself through us.</blockquote><blockquote id="4L-gGZvVg">Communicative meaning is always, in its depths, affective; it remains rooted in the sensual dimension of experience, born of the body‚Äôs native capacity to resonate with other bodies and with the landscape as a whole.</blockquote><blockquote id="msRk0JDAf">We appropriate new words and phrases first through their expressive tonality and texture, through the way they feel in the mouth or roll off the tongue, and it is this direct, felt significance‚Äîthe taste of a word or phrase, the way it influences or modulates the body‚Äîthat provides the fertile, polyvalent source for all the more refined and rarefied meanings which that term may come to have for us.</blockquote><blockquote id="tYueuy5EW">Merleau-Ponty‚Äôs first point is that words, even when they finally achieve the ability to carry referential and, eventually, conceptual levels of meaning, never completely lose that primitive, strictly phonemic, level of ‚Äòaffective‚Äô meaning which is not translatable into their conceptual definitions. There is, he argues, an affective tonality, a mode of conveying meaning beneath the level of thought, beneath the level of the words themselves¬†‚Ä¶¬†which is contained in the words just insofar as they are <a class="ref" href="/topics/pattern">Pattern</a>ed sounds, as just the sounds which this particular historical language uniquely uses, and which are much more like a melody‚Äîa ‚Äòsinging of the world‚Äô‚Äîthan fully translatable, conceptual thought. Merleau-Ponty is almost alone among philosophers of language in his sensitivity to this level of meaning.‚Ä¶3</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="UuAeBDh2L">In our own time it is language, conceived as an exclusively human property, that is most often used to demonstrate the excellence of humankind relative to all other species.</blockquote><blockquote id="d1zhQDhmU">Only by overlooking the sensuous, evocative dimension of human discourse, and attending solely to the denotative and conventional aspect of verbal communication, can we hold ourselves apart from, and outside of, the rest of animate <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>.</blockquote><blockquote id="v8pG-_dSt">It is by a complementary shift of attention that one may suddenly come to hear the familiar song of a blackbird or a thrush in a surprisingly new manner‚Äînot just as a pleasant melody repeated mechanically, as on a tape player in the background, but as active, meaningful speech.</blockquote><blockquote id="txQGdUTzJ">The enigma that is language, constituted as much by silence as by sounds, is not an inert or static structure, but an evolving bodily field. It is like a vast, living fabric continually being woven by those who speak.</blockquote><blockquote id="ZjnpOk6Cq">Indeed, all truly meaningful speech is inherently creative, using established words in ways they have never quite been used before, and thus altering, ever so slightly, the whole webwork of the language. Wild, living speech takes up, from within, the interconnected matrix of the language and gestures with it, subjecting the whole structure to a ‚Äúcoherent deformation.‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote id="A6OLXHhGo">While individual speech acts are surely guided by the structured lattice of the language, that lattice is nothing other than the sedimented result of all previous acts of speech, and will itself be altered by the very expressive activity it now guides.</blockquote><blockquote id="NibU5ghi2">Language is not a fixed or ideal form, but an evolving medium we collectively inhabit, a vast topological matrix in which the speaking bodies are generative sites, vortices where the matrix itself is continually being spun out of the silence of sensorial experience.</blockquote><blockquote id="EfNdCIe7O">Ultimately, then, it is not the human body alone but rather the whole of the sensuous world that provides the deep structure of language. As we ourselves dwell and move within language, so, ultimately, do the other animals and animate things of the world; if we do not notice them there, it is only because language has forgotten its expressive depths.</blockquote><blockquote id="yAcLQ6dLv">Only if words are felt, bodily presences, like echoes or waterfalls, can we understand the power of spoken language to influence, alter, and transform the perceptual world.</blockquote><blockquote id="hqQoFaU9A">The complex interchange that we call ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù is rooted in the non-verbal exchange always already going on between our own flesh and the flesh of the world.</blockquote><blockquote id="P-9O7s0T4">Nonhuman nature seems to have withdrawn from both our speaking and our senses. What event could have precipitated this double withdrawal, constricting our ways of speaking even as it muffled our ears and set a veil before our eyes?</blockquote><blockquote id="4h7oUOdyl">The fecundity and flourishing diversity of the North American continent led the earliest European explorers to speak of this terrain as a primeval and unsettled wilderness‚Äîyet this continent had been continuously inhabited by human cultures for at least ten thousand years.</blockquote><blockquote id="xxi_GxLft">European civilization‚Äôs neglect of the natural world and its needs has clearly been encouraged by a style of awareness that disparages sensorial reality, denigrating the visible and tangible order of things on behalf of some absolute source assumed to exist entirely beyond, or outside of, the bodily world.</blockquote><blockquote id="r1vjgF45g">These letters I print across the page, the scratches and scrawls you now focus upon, trailing off across the white surface, are hardly different from the footprints of prey left in the snow. We read these traces with organs honed over millennia by our tribal ancestors, moving instinctively from one track to the next, picking up the trail afresh whenever it leaves off, hunting the meaning, which would be the meeting with the Other.</blockquote><blockquote id="IW22PkbIH">With the advent of the aleph-beth, a new distance opens between human culture and the rest of <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>.</blockquote><blockquote id="azuXy3cC0">While the Semitic name had served as a reminder of the worldy origin of the letter, the Greek name served only to designate the human-made letter itself.</blockquote><blockquote id="l2UccZfL2">The written fragments of Heraclitus or of Empedocles give evidence of a radically new, literate reflection combined with a more traditional, oral preoccupation with a sensuous nature still felt to be mysteriously animate and alive, filled with immanent powers. In the words of the pre-Socratic philosopher Thales, ‚Äúall things are full of gods.‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote id="KefIYRFh2">Plato, or rather the association between the literate Plato and his mostly nonliterate teacher Socrates (469?‚Äì399 B.C.E.), may be recognized as the hinge on which the sensuous, mimetic, profoundly embodied style of consciousness proper to orality gave way to the more detached, abstract mode of thinking engendered by alphabetic literacy.</blockquote><blockquote id="rsrWTe-GD">Eric Havelock has suggested that the famed ‚ÄúSocratic dialectic‚Äù‚Äîwhich, in its simplest form, consisted in asking a speaker to explain what he has said‚Äîwas primarily a method for disrupting the mimetic thought patterns of oral culture.</blockquote><blockquote id="yTjqmU4KG">By asking the speaker to explain himself or to repeat his statement in different terms, Socrates forced his interlocutors to separate themselves, for the first time, from their own words‚Äîto separate themselves, that is, from the phrases and formulas that had become habitual through the constant repetition of traditional teaching stories.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="jbqM_Cbgk">By continually asking his interlocutors to repeat and explain what they had said in other words, by getting them thus to listen to and ponder their own speaking, Socrates stunned his listeners out of the mnemonic trance demanded by orality, and hence out of the sensuous, storied realm to which they were accustomed. Small wonder that some Athenians complained that Socrates‚Äô conversation had the numbing effect of a stingray‚Äôs electric shock.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="fGR9BYPDA">This new, seemingly autonomous, reflective awareness is called, by Socrates, the psyche, a term he thus twists from its earlier, Homeric significance as the invisible breath that animates the living body and that remains, as kind of wraith or ghost, after the body‚Äôs death. (The term psych√™ was derived from an older Greek term, psychein, which meant ‚Äúto breathe‚Äù or ‚Äúto blow‚Äù.) For Plato, as for Socrates, the psych√™ is now that aspect of oneself that is refined and strengthened by turning away from the ordinary sensory world in order to contemplate the <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> Ideas, the pure and eternal forms that, alone, truly exist.</blockquote><blockquote id="ciZZxrvfA">Here is Plato, from whom virtually all Western philosophers draw their literary ancestry, disparaging writing as nothing more than a pastime! What are we to make of these statements?</blockquote><blockquote id="fSP3T8jdb">But it was hardly possible to discern the pervasive influence of letters upon patterns of perception and contemplation in general. Similarly, today we are simply unable to discern with any clarity the manner in which our own perceptions and thoughts are being shifted by our sensory involvement with electronic technologies, since any thinking that seeks to discern such a shift is itself subject to the very effect that it strives to thematize.</blockquote><blockquote id="1Kw0wuzrs">Socrates‚Äô claim that trees have nothing to teach is a vivid indicator of the extent to which the human senses in <a class="ref" href="/topics/athens">Athens</a> had already withdrawn from direct participation with the natural landscape.</blockquote><blockquote id="HrclCmw4w">Without writing, knowledge of the diverse properties of particular animals, plants, and places can be preserved only by being woven into stories, into vital tales wherein the specific characteristics of the plant are made evident through a narrated series of events and interactions.</blockquote><blockquote id="kcmgQtCxr">In this light, that which we literates misconstrue as a na√Øve attempt at causal explanation may be recognized as a sophisticated mnemonic method whereby precise knowledge is preserved and passed along from generation to generation.</blockquote><blockquote id="culSgVo4g">Thus, my divergent senses meet up with each other in the surrounding world, converging and commingling in the things I perceive.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="da7HwpZpd">We may think of the sensing body as a kind of open circuit that completes itself only in things, and in the world.</blockquote><blockquote id="StPAS_Swl">As a Zu√±i elder focuses her eyes upon a cactus and hears the cactus begin to speak, so we focus our eyes upon these printed marks and immediately hear voices. We hear spoken words, witness strange scenes or visions, even experience other lives. As nonhuman animals, plants, and even ‚Äúinanimate‚Äù rivers once spoke to our tribal ancestors, so the ‚Äúinert‚Äù letters on the page now speak to us! This is a form of animism that we take for granted, but it is animism nonetheless‚Äîas mysterious as a talking stone.</blockquote><blockquote id="yIiXEgTw2">Only when the written characters lost all explicit reference to visible, natural phenomena did we move into a new order of participation. Only when those images came to be associated, alphabetically, with purely human-made sounds, and even the names of the letters lost all worldly, extrahuman significance, could speech or language come to be experienced as an exclusively human power.</blockquote><blockquote id="V5DMqcS2C">One time I went to L.A., training for mechanic. It was no good, sure no good. I start drinking, hang around bars all the time. I start getting into trouble with my wife, fight sometimes with her. It was bad. I forget about this country here around Cibecue. I forget all the names and stories. I don‚Äôt hear them in my mind anymore. I forget how to live right, forget how to be strong.</blockquote><blockquote id="JuYtCKrN3">The telling of stories, like singing and praying, would seem to be an almost ceremonial act, an ancient and necessary mode of speech that tends the earthly rootedness of human language. For narrated events, as Basso reminds us, always happen somewhere. And for an oral culture, that locus is never merely incidental to those occurrences. The events belong, as it were, to the place, and to tell the <a class="ref" href="/topics/story">Story</a> of those events is to let the place itself speak through the telling.</blockquote><blockquote id="-AfCkWDSW">As we have also discerned, the ancient aleph-beth, as the first thoroughly phonetic writing system, prioritized the human voice. The increasingly literate Israelites found themselves caught up in a vital relationship not with the expressive natural forms around them, nor with the static images or idols common to pictographic or ideographic cultures, but with an all-powerful human voice. It was a voice that clearly preceded, and outlasted, every individual life‚Äîthe voice, it would seem, of eternity itself‚Äîbut which nevertheless addressed the Hebrew nation directly, speaking, first and foremost, through the written letters.</blockquote><blockquote id="L-iJgKtJD">By carrying on its lettered surface the vital stories earlier carried by the terrain itself, the written text became a kind of portable homeland for the Hebrew people. And indeed it is only thus, by virtue of this portable ground, that the Jewish people have been able to preserve their singular culture, and thus themselves, while in an almost perpetual state of exile from the actual lands where their ancestral stories unfolded.</blockquote><blockquote id="U5Bw_qhE-">The Jewish sense of exile was never merely a state of separation from a specific locale, from a particular ground; it was (and is) also a sense of separation from the very possibility of being placed, from the very possibility of being entirely at <a class="ref" href="/topics/home">Home</a>. This deeper sense of displacement, this sense of always already being in exile, is inseparable, I suggest, from alphabetic literacy, this great and difficult magic of which the Hebrews were the first real caretakers.</blockquote><blockquote id="kbUkl5SkX">It is thus that, in Hebrew tradition, the expulsion from the eternity of Eden (and, later, the destruction of the Temple) is mirrored, at the other end of sequential history, by the promised return from exile, the coming of the Messiah, and an end to separated time. The forward trajectory of time, that is, will at last open outward, flowing back into the spacious eternity of living place (the ‚Äúpromised land‚Äù), and so into a golden age of <a class="ref" href="/topics/peace">Peace</a> between all nations.</blockquote><blockquote id="j__z7hVex">The burning alive of tens of thousands of women (most of them herbalists and midwives from peasant backgrounds) as ‚Äúwitches‚Äù during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries may usefully be understood as the attempted, and nearly successful, extermination of the last orally preserved traditions of Europe‚Äîthe last traditions rooted in the direct, participatory experience of plants, animals, and elements‚Äîin order to clear the way for the dominion of alphabetic reason over a natural world increasingly construed as a passive and mechanical set of objects.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="Go_qfU4V_">It is this remarkable fit between temporal concept (the ‚Äúpresent‚Äù) and spatial percept (the enveloping presence of the land) that accounts, I believe, for the relatively stable and solid nature of this experience, and that prompts me to wonder whether ‚Äútime‚Äù and ‚Äúspace‚Äù are really as distinct as I was taught to believe.</blockquote><blockquote id="2kGnVatUp">The conceptual abstraction that we commonly term ‚Äúthe future‚Äù would seem to be born from our bodily awareness of that which is hidden beyond the horizon‚Äîof that which exceeds, and thus holds open, the living present. What we commonly term ‚Äúthe past‚Äù would seem to be rooted in our carnal sense of that which is hidden under the ground‚Äîof that which resists, and thus supports, the living present. As ground and horizon, these dimensions are no more temporal than they are spatial, no more mental than they are bodily and sensorial.</blockquote><blockquote id="Zz5AXXWxc">In Being and Time, Heidegger asserts that the present has its own ecstasy, its own proper transcendence, its own ‚Äú¬†‚Äòwhither‚Äô to which one is carried away.‚Äù54 The implication is that phenomena can be hidden not just within the past or the future, but also within the very thickness of the present, itself‚Äîthat there is an enigmatic, hidden dimension at the very heart of the sensible present, into which phenomena may withdraw and out of which they continually emerge.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="iYtNtfLy9">Indeed, the ineffability of the air seems akin to the ineffability of awareness itself, and we should not be surprised that many indigenous peoples construe awareness, or ‚Äú<a class="ref" href="/topics/mind">Mind</a>,‚Äù not as a power that resides inside their heads, but rather as a quality that they themselves are inside of, along with the other animals and the plants, the mountains and the clouds.</blockquote><blockquote id="O7jRz4jrR">When a Navajo person wishes to renew or reestablish, in the world, the harmonious condition of well-being and beauty expressed by the Navajo word hozho he must first strive, through ritual, to create this harmony and peacefulness within his own being.
