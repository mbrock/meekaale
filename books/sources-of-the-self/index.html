We think of our thoughts, ideas, or feelings as being “within” us, while the objects in the world which these mental states bear on are “without”.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The unconscious is for us within, and we think of the depths of the unsaid, the unsayable, the powerful inchoate feelings and affinities and fears which dispute with us the control of our lives, as inner.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>We are creatures with inner depths; with partly unexplored and dark interiors.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The localization is not a universal one, which human beings recognize as a matter of course, as they do for instance that their heads are above their torsos. Rather it is a function of a historically limited mode of self-interpretation, one which has become dominant in the modern West and which may indeed spread thence to other parts of the globe, but which had a beginning in time and space and may have an end.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>So we naturally come to think that we have selves the way we have heads or arms, and inner depths the way we have hearts or livers, as a matter of hard, interpretation-free fact.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section></article></html>
