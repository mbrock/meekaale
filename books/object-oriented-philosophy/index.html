Harmanâ€™s own analysis of appearance cannot but dissolve the â€˜glaringly obvious factâ€™ of discreteness that he himself held up against Heideggerâ€™s purported holism. His radical dissociation of the individuation of sensual objects from the individuation of real objects precludes any appeal to apparent discreteness in order to prove real discreteness, and thereby undermines his seemingly radical individualism. If we cannot know anything about the criteria of individuation of real objects, then we are left with the real possibility that there might only be one.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
