Postscript to the Second Edition</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p>From Wikipedia</p><div class="indent"><blockquote>"The nineteenth-century critic who has most lastingly and profoundly influenced MacIntyre is not Nietzsche but Marx—indeed, After Virtue originates in MacIntyre's plans to write a book repairing the moral weaknesses of Marxism.”</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>"His critique of capitalism, and its associated liberal ideology and bureaucratic state (including what, in After Virtue, he condemned as the state capitalism of the USSR) is not expressed in traditional Marxist terms.”</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>“Instead, it is written as a defence of ordinary social ‘practices’, and of the ‘goods internal to practices’. Pursuit of these helps to give narrative structure and <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligibility">Intelligibility</a> to our lives, but these goods must be defended against their corruption by ‘institutions’, which pursue such 'external goods' as money, power and status.”</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><p><strong>Author</strong>: <a class="ref" href="/topics/alasdair-macintyre">Alasdair MacIntyre</a></p><div class="indent"></div><p><strong>Full Title</strong>: After Virtue</p><div class="indent"></div><p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/414oRew%2BxbL._SL400_.jpg"></p><div class="indent"></div><h3>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/september-7th-2020">September 7th, 2020</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote>For the modern radical is as confident in the moral expression of his stances and consequently in the assertive uses of the rhetoric of morality as any conservative has ever been. Whatever else he denounces in our culture he is certain that it still possesses the moral resources which he requires in order to denounce it. Everything else may be, in his eyes, in disorder; but the language of morality is in order, just as it is. That he too may be being betrayed by the very language he uses is not a thought available to him. It is the aim of this book to make that thought available to radicals, liberals and conservatives alike. I cannot however expect to make it palatable; for if it is true, we are all already in a state so disastrous that there are no large remedies for it.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>It is precisely because there is in our society no established way of deciding between these claims that moral argument appears to be necessarily interminable. From our rival conclusions we can argue back to our rival premises; but when we do arrive at our premises argument ceases and the invocation of one premise against another becomes a matter of pure assertion and counter-assertion. Hence perhaps the slightly shrill tone of so much moral debate.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Contemporary moral disagreements of a certain kind cannot be resolved, because no moral disagreements of that kind in any age, past, present or future, can be resolved. What you present as a contingent feature of our culture, standing in need of some special, perhaps historical explanation, is a necessary feature of all cultures which possess evaluative discourse. This is a challenge which cannot be avoided at an early stage in this argument. Can it be defeated?</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The Predecessor Culture and the Enlightenment Project of Justifying Morality</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>at least the first phase of the French revolution can be understood as an attempt to enter by political means this North European culture and so to abolish the gap between French ideas and French social and political life. Certainly Kant recognized the French revolution as a political expression of thought akin to his own.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>When the Catholic mass becomes a genre available for concert performance by Protestants, when we listen to the scripture because of what Bach wrote rather than because of what St. Matthew wrote, then sacred texts are being preserved in a form in which the traditional links with belief have been broken, even in some measure for those who still count themselves believers.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>traditional distinction between the religious and the aesthetic has been blurred.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>In Latin, as in ancient Greek, there is no word correctly translated by our word ‘moral’;</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Certainly ‘moral’ is the etymological descendant of ‘moralis’. But ‘moralis’, like its Greek predecessor ‘êthikos’—Cicero invented ‘moralis’ to translate the Greek word in the De Fato—means ‘pertaining to character’ where a man’s character is nothing other than his set dispositions to behave systematically in one way rather than another, to lead one particular kind of life.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>It is only in the later seventeenth century and the eighteenth century, when this distinguishing of the moral from the theological, the legal and the aesthetic has become a received doctrine that the project of an independent rational justification of morality becomes not merely the concern of individual thinkers, but central to Northern European culture.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>This element of arbitrariness in our moral culture was presented as a philosophical discovery—indeed as a discovery of a disconcerting, even shocking, kind—long before it became a commonplace of everyday discourse.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>I think especially of those young men of my father’s generation who watched their own earlier ethical principles die along with the deaths of their friends in the trenches in the mass murder of Ypres and the Somme; and who returned determined that nothing was ever going to matter to them again and invented the aesthetic triviality of the nineteen-twenties.)</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>the custodians of the Christian revelation,</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>there is a deep incoherence in Enten-Eller; if the ethical has some basis, it cannot be provided by the notion of radical <a class="ref" href="/topics/choice">choice</a>.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>It is perhaps this combination of novelty and tradition which accounts for the incoherence at the heart of Kierkegaard’s position.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>It is certainly, so I shall argue, just this deeply incoherent combination of the novel and the inherited which is the logical outcome of the Enlightenment’s project to provide a rational foundation for and justification of morality.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Although Kant’s Lutheran childhood in Königsberg was a hundred years before Kierkegaard’s Lutheran childhood in Copenhagen the same inherited morality marked both men.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Kierkegaard and Kant agree in their conception of morality, but Kierkegaard inherits that conception together with an understanding that the project of giving a rational vindication of morality has failed.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Kant’s failure provided Kierkegaard with his starting-point: the act of <a class="ref" href="/topics/choice">choice</a> had to be called in to do the work that reason could not do.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>In a world of secular rationality religion could no longer provide such a shared background and foundation for moral discourse and action; and the failure of philosophy to provide what religion could no longer furnish was an important cause of philosophy losing its central cultural role and becoming a marginal, narrowly academic subject.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Suppose that during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the meaning and implications of the key terms used in moral utterance had changed their character; it could then turn out to be the case that what had once been valid inferences from or to some particular moral premise or conclusion would no longer be valid inferences from or to what seemed to be the same factual premise or moral conclusion.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>It follows that the concept of a watch cannot be defined independently of the concept of a good watch nor the concept of a farmer independently of that of a good farmer; and that the criterion of something’s being a watch and the criterion of something’s being a good watch—and so also for ‘farmer’ and for all other functional concepts—are not independent of each other. Now clearly both sets of criteria—as is evidenced by the examples given in the last paragraph—are factual. Hence any argument which moves from premises which assert that the appropriate criteria are satisfied to a conclusion which asserts that ‘That is a good such-and-such’, where ‘such-and-such’ picks out an item specified by a functional concept, will be a valid argument which moves from factual premises to an evaluative conclusion.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>So the ‘No “ought” conclusion from “is” premises’ principle becomes an inescapable truth for philosophers whose culture possesses only the impoverished moral vocabulary which results from the episodes I have recounted. That it was taken to be a timeless logical truth was a sign of a deep lack of historical consciousness which then informed and even now infects too much of moral philosophy. For its initial proclamation was itself a crucial historical event. It signals both a final break with the classical tradition and the decisive breakdown of the eighteenth-century project of justifying morality in the context of the inherited, but already incoherent, fragments left behind from tradition.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>I take it then that both the <a class="ref" href="/topics/utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a> of the middle and late nineteenth century and the analytical moral philosophy of the middle and late twentieth century are alike unsuccessful attempts to rescue the autonomous moral agent from the predicament in which the failure of the Enlightenment project of providing him with a secular, rational justification for his moral allegiances had left him.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Each moral agent now spoke unconstrained by the externalities of divine law, natural <a class="ref" href="/topics/teleology">Teleology</a> or hierarchical authority; but why should anyone else now listen to him? It was and is to this question that both <a class="ref" href="/topics/utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a> and analytical moral philosophy must be understood as attempting to give cogent answers; and if my argument is correct, it is precisely this question which both fail to answer cogently.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Nonetheless almost everyone, philosopher and non-philosopher alike, continues to speak and write as if one of these projects had succeeded.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Contemporary moral experience as a consequence has a paradoxical character. For each of us is taught to see himself or herself as an autonomous moral agent; but each of us also becomes engaged by modes of practice, aesthetic or bureaucratic, which involve us in manipulative relationships with others.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The incoherence of our attitudes and our experience arises from the incoherent conceptual scheme which we have inherited.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>What they agreed in denying and excluding was in large part all those aspects of the classical view of the world which were Aristotelian.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Private corporations similarly justify their activities by referring to their possession of similar resources of competence. Expertise becomes a commodity for which rival state agencies and rival private corporations compete. Civil servants and managers alike justify themselves and their claims to authority, power and money by invoking their own competence as scientific managers of social change.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Weber’s account of <a class="ref" href="/topics/bureaucracy">Bureaucracy</a> notoriously has many flaws. But in his insistence that the rationality of adjusting means to ends in the most economical and efficient way is the central task of the bureaucrat and that therefore the appropriate mode of justification of his activity by the bureaucrat lies in the appeal to his (or later her) ability to deploy a body of scientific and above all social scientific knowledge, organized in terms of and understood as comprising a set of universal law-like generalizations, Weber provided the key to much of the modern age.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>One could go on multiplying examples of the predictive ineptitude of economists, and with demography the situation has been even worse, but this would be grossly unfair; for economists and demographers have at least gone on record with their predictions in systematic fashion. But most sociologists and political scientists keep no systematic records of their predictions and those futurologists who scatter predictions lavishly around rarely, if ever, advert to their predictive failures afterward. Indeed in the notorious article by Karl Deutsch, John Platt and Dieter Senghors (Science, March 1971) where sixty-two alleged major social science achievements are listed it is impressive that in not a single case is the predictive power of the theories listed assessed in statistical terms</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>That the social sciences are predictively weak and that they do not discover law-like generalizations may clearly turn out to be two symptoms of the same condition. But what is that condition? Ought we simply to conclude that predictive weakness reinforces the conclusion implied by the conjunction of the conventional philosophy of social science and the facts about what social scientists do and do not achieve; namely, that the social sciences have substantially failed at their task? Or ought we perhaps instead to question both the conventional philosophy of social science and the claim to expertise by social scientists who seek to hire themselves out to government and corporations? What I am suggesting is that the true achievements of the social sciences are being concealed from us—and from many social scientists themselves—by systematic misinterpretation.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>social scientists themselves characteristically and for the most part do in fact adopt just such a tolerant attitude to counter-examples, an attitude very different from that of either natural scientists themselves or of Popperian philosophers of science</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>A second characteristic, closely linked to the first, of all four generalizations is that they lack not only universal quantifiers but also scope modifiers. That is, they are not only not genuinely of the form ‘For all x and some y if x has property ϕ, then y has property ψ’, but we cannot say of them in any precise way under what conditions they hold.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Confronted with the kind of consideration which I have adduced they have thought it appropriate to reply: ‘What the social sciences discover are probabilistic generalizations; and where a generalization is only probabilistic of course there can be cases which would be counter-examples if the generalization was non-probabilistic and universal.’ But this reply misses the point completely. For if the type of generalization which I have cited is to be a generalization at all, it must be something more than a mere list of instances. The probabilistic generalizations of natural science—those, say, of statistical mechanics—are indeed more than this precisely because they are as law-like as any non-probabilistic generalizations. They possess universal quantifiers—quantification is over sets, not over individuals—they entail well-defined sets of counter-factual conditionals and they are refuted by counter-examples in precisely the same way and to the same degree that other law-like generalizations are. Hence we throw no light on the status of the characteristic generalizations of the social sciences by calling them probabilistic; for they are as different from the generalizations of statistical mechanics as they are from the generalizations of Newtonian mechanics or of the gas law equations.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>We therefore have to start out afresh and in so doing to consider whether the social sciences may not have looked in the wrong place for their philosophical ancestry as well as for their logical structure. It is because modern social scientists have seen themselves as the successors of Comte and Mill and Buckle, of Helvétuis and Diderot and Condorcet, that they have presented their writings as attempted answers to the questions of their eighteenth- and nineteenth-century masters. But let us suppose once again that the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, brilliant and creative as they were, were in fact centuries not as we and they take them to be of Enlightenment, but of a peculiar kind of darkness in which men so dazzled themselves that they could no longer see and ask whether the social sciences might not have an alternative ancestry. The name which I wish to invoke is that of Machiavelli, for Machiavelli takes a very different view of the relationship between explanation and prediction from that taken by the Enlightenment.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>It is because modern social scientists have seen themselves as the successors of Comte and Mill and Buckle, of Helvétuis and Diderot and Condorcet, that they have presented their writings as attempted answers to the questions of their eighteenth- and nineteenth-century masters.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>But let us suppose once again that the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, brilliant and creative as they were, were in fact centuries not as we and they take them to be of Enlightenment, but of a peculiar kind of darkness in which men so dazzled themselves that they could no longer see and ask whether the social sciences might not have an alternative ancestry.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The name which I wish to invoke is that of Machiavelli, for Machiavelli takes a very different view of the relationship between explanation and prediction from that taken by the Enlightenment.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The conclusion that we cannot predict the future of physics is also supported by another argument, independent of Popper’s. Suppose that someone were to improve computing hardware and software, so that it became possible to write a program which would enable a computer to predict, on the basis of information about the present state of mathematics, the past history of mathematics and the talents and energies of present day mathematicians, which well-formed formulas in a given branch of mathematics—algebraic topology, say, or number theory—for which at the present we possess neither a proof nor a proof of their negation would receive such a proof within ten years. (We are not requiring that the computer identify all such well-formed formulas, but only some of them.) Such a program would have to embody a decision procedure whereby a sub-set of well-formed formulas, provable but not yet proven, were discriminated from the set of well-formed formulas. But Church has provided us with the strongest reasons for believing that for any calculus rich enough to express arithmetic, let alone algebraic topology or number theory, there can be no such decision procedure. Hence it is a truth of logic that no such computer program will ever be written and more generally therefore it is a truth of logic that the future of mathematics is unpredictable. But if the future of mathematics is unpredictable, so is a great deal else.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>It is at first sight a trivial truth that when I have not yet made up my mind which of two or more alternative and mutually exclusive courses of action to take I cannot predict which I shall take.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>For this observer who is able to predict what I cannot is of course unable to predict his own future in just the way that I am unable to predict mine; and one of the features which he will be unable to predict, since it depends in substantial part upon decisions as yet unmade by him, is how far his actions will impact upon and change the decisions made by others—</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>It is precisely insofar as we differ from God that unpredictability invades our lives.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Each of us, individually and as a member of particular social groups, seeks to embody his own plans and projects in the natural and social world. A condition of achieving this is to render as much of our natural and social environment as possible predictable and the importance of both natural and social science in our lives derives at least in part—although only in part—from their contribution to this project. At the same time each of us, individually and as a member of particular social groups, aspires to preserve his independence, his freedom, his creativity, and that inner reflection which plays so great a part in freedom and creativity, from invasion by others. We wish to disclose of ourselves no more than we think right and nobody wishes to disclose all of himself—except perhaps under the influence of some psycho-analytic illusion. We need to remain to some degree opaque and unpredictable, particularly when threatened by the predictive practices of others. The satisfaction of this need to at least some degree supplies another necessary condition for human life being meaningful in the ways that it is and can be. It is necessary, if life is to be meaningful, for us to be able to engage in long-term projects, and this requires predictability; it is necessary, if life is to be meaningful, for us to be in possession of ourselves and not merely to be the creations of other people’s projects, intentions and desires, and this requires unpredictability. We are thus involved in a world in which we are simultaneously trying to render the rest of society predictable and ourselves unpredictable, to devise generalizations which will capture the behavior of others and to cast our own behavior into forms which will elude the generalizations which others frame.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>We need to remain to some degree opaque and unpredictable, particularly when threatened by the predictive practices of others.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The expert’s claim to status and reward is fatally undermined when we recognize that he possesses no sound stock of law-like generalizations and when we realize how weak the predictive power available to him is.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The concept of managerial effectiveness is after all one more contemporary moral fiction and perhaps the most important of them all.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The dominance of the manipulative mode in our culture is not and cannot be accompanied by very much actual success in manipulation.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>But the notion of social control embodied in the notion of expertise is indeed a masquerade.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Belief in managerial expertise is then, on the view that I have taken, very like what belief in God was thought to be by Carnap and Ayer.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The fetishism of commodities has been supplemented by another just as important fetishism, that of <a class="ref" href="/topics/bureaucratic">Bureaucratic</a> skills.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>the realm of managerial expertise is one in which what purport to be objectively-grounded claims function in fact as expressions of arbitrary, but disguised, will and preference.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The effects of eighteenth-century prophecy have been to produce not scientifically managed social control, but a skillful dramatic imitation of such control.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The most effective bureaucrat is the best actor.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>But had the Polynesian culture enjoyed the blessings of analytical philosophy it is all too clear that the question of the meaning of taboo could have been resolved in a number of ways.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Why should we think about our modern uses of good, right and obligatory in any different way from that in which we think about late eighteenth-century Polynesian uses of taboo?</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>And why should we not think of <a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a> as the Kamehameha II of the European tradition?</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Whenever those immersed in the <a class="ref" href="/topics/bureaucratic">Bureaucratic</a> culture of the age try to think their way through to the moral foundations of what they are and what they do, they will discover suppressed Nietzschean premises.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Peter Berger and his co-authors (1973) have pointed out the significance of the fact that in modern societies we have neither legal nor quasi-legal recourse if we are insulted. Insults have been displaced to the margins of our cultural life where they are expressive of private emotions rather than public conflicts.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>is no wonder that the teaching of ethics is so often destructive and skeptical in its effects upon the minds of those taught.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Plato is pointing to a general state of incoherence in the use of evaluative language in Athenian culture.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>the first massive fact that we have to reckon with is the difference that it makes to the conception of the virtues when the primary moral community is no longer the kinship group, but the city-state, and not merely the city-state in general, but the Athenian democracy in particular.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>the Homeric values no longer define the moral horizon, just as the household or kinship group are now part of a larger and very different unit.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>for Athenian man, the matter is more complex. His understanding of the virtues does provide him with standards by which he can question the life of his own community and enquire whether this or that practice or policy is just.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The social obstacles derive from the way in which <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a> partitions each human life into a variety of segments, each with its own norms and modes of behavior.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>That particular actions derive their character as parts of larger wholes is a point of view alien to our dominant ways of thinking and yet one which it is necessary at least to consider if we are to begin to understand how a life may be more than a sequence of individual actions and episodes.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>liquidation of the self into a set of demarcated areas of role-playing allows no scope for the exercise of dispositions which could genuinely be accounted virtues in any sense remotely Aristotelian.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>It is a conceptual commonplace, both for philosophers and for ordinary agents, that one and the same segment of human behavior may be correctly characterized in a number of different ways. To the question ‘What is he doing?’ the answers may with equal truth and appropriateness be ‘Digging’, ‘Gardening’, ‘Taking exercise’, ‘Preparing for winter’ or ‘Pleasing his wife’.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>What is important to notice immediately is that any answer to the questions of how we are to understand or to explain a given segment of behavior will presuppose some prior answer to the question of how these different correct answers to the question ‘What is he doing?’ are related to each other.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>In my earlier example the agent’s activity may be part of the history both of the cycle of household activity and of his marriage, two histories which have happened to intersect. The household may have its own history stretching back through hundreds of years, as do the histories of some European farms, where the farm has had a life of its own, even though different families have in different periods inhabited it; and the marriage will certainly have its own history, a history which itself presupposes that a particular point has been reached in the history of the institution of marriage.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>analytical philosophers who have constructed accounts of human actions which make central the notion of ‘a’ human action.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Once we have understood its importance the claim that the concept of an action is secondary to that of an <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> action will perhaps appear less bizarre and so too will the claim that the notion of ‘an’ action, while of the highest practical importance, is always a potentially misleading abstraction.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>A central thesis then begins to emerge: man is in his actions and practice, as well as in his fictions, essentially a story-telling animal. He is not essentially, but becomes through his history, a teller of stories that aspire to truth. But the key question for men is not about their own authorship; I can only answer the question ‘What am I to do?’ if I can answer the prior question ‘Of what story or stories do I find myself a part?’ We enter human society, that is, with one or more imputed characters—roles into which we have been drafted—and we have to learn what they are in order to be able to understand how others respond to us and how our responses to them are apt to be construed.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Deprive children of stories and you leave them unscripted, anxious stutterers in their actions as in their words.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>I am someone’s son or daughter, someone else’s cousin or uncle; I am a citizen of this or that city, a member of this or that guild or profession; I belong to this clan, that tribe, this nation. Hence what is good for me has to be the good for one who inhabits these roles. As such, I inherit from the past of my family, my city, my tribe, my nation, a variety of debts, inheritances, rightful expectations and obligations. These constitute the given of my life, my moral starting point. This is in part what gives my life its own moral particularity.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The Aristotelian tradition has occupied two distinct places in my argument: first, because I have suggested that a great part of modern morality is <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> only as a set of fragmented survivals from that tradition, and indeed that the inability of modern moral philosophers to carry through their projects of analysis and justification is closely connected with the fact that the concepts with which they work are a combination of fragmented survivals and implausible modern inventions; but in addition to this the rejection of the Aristotelian tradition was a rejection of a quite distinctive kind of morality in which rules, so predominant in modern conceptions of morality, find their place in a larger scheme in which the virtues have the central place; hence the cogency of the Nietzschean rejection and refutation of modern moralities of rules, whether of a utilitarian or of a Kantian kind, did not necessarily extend to the earlier Aristotelian tradition.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote><a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>an man, the Übermensch, the man who transcends, finds his good nowhere in the social world to date, but only in that in himself which dictates his own new law and his own new table of the virtues. Why does he never find any objective good with authority over him in the social world to date? The answer is not difficult: <a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>’s portrait makes it clear that he who transcends is wanting in respect of both relationships and activities.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The attractiveness of Nietzche’s position lay in its apparent honesty. When I was setting out the case in favor of an amended and restated emotivism, it appeared to be a consequence of accepting the truth of emotivism that an honest man would no longer want to go on using most, at least, of the language of past morality because of its misleading character. And <a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a> was the only major philosopher who had not flinched from this conclusion. Since moreover the language of modern morality is burdened with pseudo-concepts such as those of utility and of natural rights, it appeared that <a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>’s resoluteness alone would rescue us from entanglement by such concepts; but it is now clear that the price to be paid for this liberation is entanglement in another set of mistakes. The concept of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>an ‘great man’ is also a pseudo-concept, although not always perhaps—unhappily—what I earlier called a fiction. It represents individualism’s final attempt to escape from its own consequences. And the <a class="ref" href="/topics/nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>an stance turns out not to be a mode of escape from or an alternative to the conceptual scheme of liberal individualist <a class="ref" href="/topics/modernity">Modernity</a>, but rather one more representative moment in its internal unfolding. And we may therefore expect liberal individualist societies to breed ‘great men’ from time to time. Alas!</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>My own conclusion is very clear. It is that on the one hand we still, in spite of the efforts of three centuries of moral philosophy and one of sociology, lack any coherent rationally defensible statement of a liberal individualist point of view; and that, on the other hand, the Aristotelian tradition can be restated in a way that restores <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligibility">Intelligibility</a> and rationality to our moral and social attitudes and commitments.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>the claim of Marxism to a morally distinctive standpoint is undermined by Marxism’s own moral history. In all those crises in which Marxists have had to take explicit moral stances—that over Bernstein’s revisionism in German social democracy at the turn of the century or that over Khruschev’s repudiation of Stalin and the Hungarian revolt in 1956, for example—Marxists have always fallen back into relatively straightforward versions of Kantianism or <a class="ref" href="/topics/utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a>. Nor is this surprising. Secreted within Marxism from the outset is a certain radical individualism.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Secreted within Marxism from the outset is a certain radical individualism. In the first chapter of Capital when Marx characterizes what it will be like ‘when the practical relations of everyday life offer to man none but perfectly <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a> and reasonable relations’ what he pictures is ‘a community of free individuals’ who have all freely agreed to their common ownership of the means of production and to various norms of production and distribution.

For however thoroughgoing its criticism of capitalist and bourgeois institutions may be, it is committed to asserting that within the society constituted by those institutions, all the human and material preconditions of a better future are being accumulated. Yet if the moral impoverishment of advanced capitalism is what so many Marxists agree that it is, whence are these resources for the future to be derived? It is not surprising that at this point Marxism tends to produce its own versions of the Übermensch: Lukacs’s ideal proletarian, Leninism’s ideal revolutionary. When Marxism does not become Weberian social democracy or crude tyranny, it tends to become Nietzschean fantasy. One of the most admirable aspects of Trotsky’s cold resolution was his refusal of all such fantasies.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>What matters at this stage is the construction of local forms of community within which civility and the intellectual and moral life can be sustained through the new dark ages which are already upon us.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>For what the progress of analytic philosophy has succeeded in establishing is that there are no grounds for belief in universal necessary principles—outside purely formal enquiries—except relative to some set of assumptions.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The consequence is that analytic philosophy has become a discipline—or a subdiscipline?—whose competence has been restricted to the study of inferences.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>it can never establish the rational acceptability of any particular position in cases where each of the alternative rival positions available has sufficient range and scope and the adherents of each are willing to pay the price necessary to secure coherence and consistency.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>What rendered Newtonian physics rationally superior to its Galilean and Aristotelian predecessors and to its Cartesian rivals was that it was able to transcend their limitations by solving problems in areas in which those predecessors and rivals could by their own standards of scientific progress make no progress.

The paradigm of aesthetic expression is the romantic lover who is immersed in his own passion.

Each of the two ways of life is informed by different concepts, incompatible attitudes, rival premises.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The second feature of Enten-Eller to which we must now turn concerns the deep internal inconsistency—partially concealed by the book’s form—between its concept of radical <a class="ref" href="/topics/choice">choice</a> and its concept of the ethical.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>How I feel at any given moment is irrelevant to the question of how I must live.

This rejoinder embodies a misconception, which in part arises from a confusion between the Platonic notion of the soul and that of Catholic Christianity. For the Platonist, as later for the Cartesian, the soul, preceding all bodily and social existence, must indeed possess an identity prior to all social roles; but for the Catholic Christian, as earlier for the Aristotelian, the body and the soul are not two linked substances. I am my body and my body is social, born to those parents in this community with a specific social identity.

The virtues, he grants, will enable one to a large degree to cope with adversity, but great misfortunes such as Priam’s exclude one from eudaimonia—as do ugliness, low birth and childlessness.

This conclusion agrees of course with my own.

It has a number of key features. The first is that Aristotle takes the conclusion to a practical syllogism to be a particular kind of action. The notion that an argument can terminate in an action of course offends Humean and post-Humean philosophical prejudices, according to which only statements (or, in some particularly barbarous versions, sentences) can have truth-values and enter into those relationships of consistency and inconsistency which partially define deductive argument.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Practical reasoning then has, on Aristotle’s view, four essential elements. There are first of all the wants and goals of the agent, presupposed by but not expressed in, his reasoning. Without these there would be no context for the reasoning, and the major and minor premises could not adequately determine what kind of thing the agent is to do. The second element is the major premise, an assertion to the effect that doing or having or seeking such-and-such is the type of thing that is good for or needed by a so-and-so (where the agent uttering the syllogism falls under the latter description). The third element is the minor premise wherein the agent, relying on a perceptual judgment, asserts that this is an instance or occasion of the requisite kind. The conclusion, as I already said, is the action.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The great Australian philosopher John Anderson urged us ‘not to ask of a social institution: “What end or purpose does it serve?” but rather, “Of what conflicts is it the scene?”’ (Passmore 1962, p. xxii). If Aristotle had asked this question both of the polis and of the individual agent, he would have had an additional resource for understanding the teleological character of both the virtues and the social forms which provide them with a context. For it was Anderson’s insight—a Sophoclean insight—that it is through conflict and sometimes only through conflict that we learn what our ends and purposes are.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><h3>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/february-25th-2021">February 25th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote>Her heroines seek the good through seeking their own good in marriage.
