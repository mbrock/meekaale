It is a process, a logic, an algorithm if you want, by which a unit attempts to make sense of another.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Lists offer an antidote to the obsession with Deleuzean becoming, a preference for continuity and smoothness instead of sequentiality and fitfulness.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Lists remind us that no matter how fluidly a system may operate, its members nevertheless remain utterly isolated, mutual aliens.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The phenomenologist who performs carpentry creates a machine that tries to replicate the unit operation of anotherâ€™s experience. Like a space probe sent out to record, process, and report information, the alien phenomenologistâ€™s carpentry seeks to capture and characterize an experience it can never fully understand, offering a rendering satisfactory enough to allow the artifactâ€™s operator to gain some insight into an alien thingâ€™s experience. Again I turn to computation for examples.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section></article></html>
