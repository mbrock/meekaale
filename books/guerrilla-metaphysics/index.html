In Ortega‚Äôs own magnificent words, miles removed from the neurasthenic jargon of the postmoderns: ‚ÄúThe result ... is the annihilation of what both objects are as practical images. When they collide with one another their hard carapaces crack and the internal matter, in a molten state, acquires the softness of plasm, ready to receive a new form and structure.‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote id="APmQ5yQll">there is the cypress as a unified thing that I encounter, that fills up some part of my life as I adopt a definite lived stance toward it, however faint.

This opportunity is certainly preferable to being a war casualty or a slave, but it does not yet say enough about what it is that we want the microphone to do for our voices. The kind of recognition we would prefer is always far more specific, since we often feel ourselves to be so painfully mutable that any specific role will do‚Äîthe friendly one, the one who cooks, the exotic traveler, the one who sings like Caruso, or just the one who likes to be spoken to in such-and-such a way and not another.</blockquote><blockquote id="fTNwRLvcX">There is a profound need to escape the apparently infinite flexible subjectivity within, which feels far more amorphous to us than to anyone else.</blockquote><blockquote id="KQJLGS5NR">Contrary to the usual view, what we really want is to be objects‚Äînot as means to an end like paper or oil, but in the sense that we want to be like the Grand Canyon or a guitar hero or a piece of silver: distinct forces to be reckoned with.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="Kc-1U039q">we would rather be charmed and charming than be free,</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><h3 id="l2dp74yyJ">Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-01-11">January 11th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote id="OToGNkYSJ">‚Äúthe secret blackness of milk,‚Äù</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><h3 id="2-tZtOc_S">Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-04">March 4th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote id="H6M0MZ8v4">We never reach some final layer of tiny components that explains everything else, but enter instead into an indef inite regress of parts and wholes. Every object is both a substance and a complex of relations.</blockquote><blockquote id="bEDxXk7-g">When two objects enter into genuine relation, even if they do not permanently fuse together, they generate a reality that has all of the features that we require of an object. Through their mere relation, they create something that has not existed before, and which is truly one.</blockquote><blockquote id="3zDf94l4T">When a house is assembled from pillars, beams, baseboards, chimneys, and carpets, it siphons from these objects only the limited number of features that it needs. The house never fully grasps or even deploys the total reality of its stairwells and electrical cords, which withdraw from the house into the shadows of their private reality. In other words, a thing relates to its own parts in the same way that it relates to other things, and indeed in the same way that we ourselves relate to things: namely, by distorting them, caricaturing them, bringing them into play only partially.</blockquote><blockquote id="jcSSWLOfy">Levinas holds that the prehuman cosmos is a single anonymous rumble, a kind of apeiron of existence, so that the kaleidoscope of specific colorful and sonorous entities emerges only in a human experience that banishes the life of inanimate objects from sight.</blockquote><blockquote id="kA068ZLUE">two objects can interact at all, they must both already be suspended in the same ether, linked by the vicarious cause of a larger object that they themselves both use as a base or alibi for their relationship.</blockquote><blockquote id="0TP7SqdDV">All objects relate only on the inside of another object; all perception occurs on the inside of an object. Hence, causation and perception are equivalent to objects and the interior of objects.</blockquote><blockquote id="Cm_qLa_Km">All reality unfolds in the interior of an object‚Äîor rather, in the interiors of countless objects, stretching above and below each other indefinitely.</blockquote><blockquote id="bwuBOoOEV">The inside of an object is a fiery cauldron in which other objects show their faces and sometimes manage to affect each other more deeply than before.</blockquote><blockquote id="FMhDOBYrm">Although everything in the volcanic core of an object is unified simply by the fact of belonging to that object, this is merely unification from above; on the inside, it is articulated into countless facets, notes, qualities, accidents, and other halos, echoes, and shadows.</blockquote><blockquote id="NXZNnT2Wj">Since all relations are objects, and all objects are formed in turn of a swarming internal empire of relations, the basic model of the world that results is both simple and endlessly pluralistic: namely, nothing exists but the interiors of objects, since objects are nothing but their interiors.</blockquote></div><h3 id="IqYQfDely">Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-05">March 5th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote id="WUFcrK3iX">If every object is a vacuum, it is equally true that every vacuum must contain a world‚Äîa medium in which distinct qualities interact or at least float side-by-side in some sort of charged ether.</blockquote><blockquote id="3m53pjo_x">In astrophysics, Lee Smolin has theorized that every black hole contains an entire universe of its own.
