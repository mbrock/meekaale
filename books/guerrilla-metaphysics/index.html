In Ortega‚Äôs own magnificent words, miles removed from the neurasthenic jargon of the postmoderns: ‚ÄúThe result ... is the annihilation of what both objects are as practical images. When they collide with one another their hard carapaces crack and the internal matter, in a molten state, acquires the softness of plasm, ready to receive a new form and structure.‚Äù</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>there is the cypress as a unified thing that I encounter, that fills up some part of my life as I adopt a definite lived stance toward it, however faint. Insofar as the cypress enters the sphere of my life, it is not just a sensory image, but also a single executant reality within my life, an actual experience that I undergo, a mysterious unity at which all my attitudes aim.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>it is from this strange concealed integrity of individual images that metaphor draws its power‚Äînot from the genuine reality of each thing, which language is powerless to unveil.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>a shadowy intuition of brooding vegetative power combined with funerary gloom</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>the flame-feeling, with its festive joy, its delight in destructive power, its jubilation of infernal color, and its hypnotic void of information.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><h3>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/november-29th-2020">November 29th, 2020</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote>everything hinges for Ortega on a fundamental contrast between two modes of being that he terms execution and image.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Between my life as it executes itself and the life of another as seen from outside, there is an absolute gulf‚Äîa kind of ontological difference.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>But notice that this unbridgeable rift is not confined to our perceptions of other people: the same dualism occurs even in cases of introspection.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>To observe something, no matter how closely, is not to be it; to look at a thing is not the same thing as to stand in its place and undergo its fate, even if what we are observing is our own psychic lives.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>‚Äúgold has forged the keys to Nixon‚Äôs tomb.‚Äù</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>To return to the case of the cypress and the flame, in metaphor their images are destroyed, and even their independent existence as proper names is swept away.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Since the two images are unable actually to melt together instantly by way of their truly minimal common qualities, the cryptic essences that my life senses in them remain before me in a kind of permanent collision.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>their hard carapaces crack as they fill each other with molten plasm.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>We simply sense an identity, we live executantly this being, the cypress-flame.‚Äù</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>To create such an object is to de-create the external images that normally identify it, reshaping the plasma of their qualities into a hybrid structure.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><h3>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/december-27th-2020">December 27th, 2020</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote>It is simply not the case that our fundamental wish is to be viewed as dignified thinking free subjects with a chance to speak at the microphone of the universal assembly. This opportunity is certainly preferable to being a war casualty or a slave, but it does not yet say enough about what it is that we want the microphone to do for our voices. The kind of recognition we would prefer is always far more specific, since we often feel ourselves to be so painfully mutable that any specific role will do‚Äîthe friendly one, the one who cooks, the exotic traveler, the one who sings like Caruso, or just the one who likes to be spoken to in such-and-such a way and not another.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>There is a profound need to escape the apparently infinite flexible subjectivity within, which feels far more amorphous to us than to anyone else.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Contrary to the usual view, what we really want is to be objects‚Äînot as means to an end like paper or oil, but in the sense that we want to be like the Grand Canyon or a guitar hero or a piece of silver: distinct forces to be reckoned with.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>we would rather be charmed and charming than be free,</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><h3>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/january-11th-2021">January 11th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote>‚Äúthe secret blackness of milk,‚Äù</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><h3>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-4th-2021">March 4th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote>We never reach some final layer of tiny components that explains everything else, but enter instead into an indef inite regress of parts and wholes. Every object is both a substance and a complex of relations.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>When two objects enter into genuine relation, even if they do not permanently fuse together, they generate a reality that has all of the features that we require of an object. Through their mere relation, they create something that has not existed before, and which is truly one.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>When a house is assembled from pillars, beams, baseboards, chimneys, and carpets, it siphons from these objects only the limited number of features that it needs. The house never fully grasps or even deploys the total reality of its stairwells and electrical cords, which withdraw from the house into the shadows of their private reality. In other words, a thing relates to its own parts in the same way that it relates to other things, and indeed in the same way that we ourselves relate to things: namely, by distorting them, caricaturing them, bringing them into play only partially.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Levinas holds that the prehuman cosmos is a single anonymous rumble, a kind of apeiron of existence, so that the kaleidoscope of specific colorful and sonorous entities emerges only in a human experience that banishes the life of inanimate objects from sight.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>two objects can interact at all, they must both already be suspended in the same ether, linked by the vicarious cause of a larger object that they themselves both use as a base or alibi for their relationship.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>All objects relate only on the inside of another object; all perception occurs on the inside of an object. Hence, causation and perception are equivalent to objects and the interior of objects.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>All reality unfolds in the interior of an object‚Äîor rather, in the interiors of countless objects, stretching above and below each other indefinitely.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The inside of an object is a fiery cauldron in which other objects show their faces and sometimes manage to affect each other more deeply than before.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Although everything in the volcanic core of an object is unified simply by the fact of belonging to that object, this is merely unification from above; on the inside, it is articulated into countless facets, notes, qualities, accidents, and other halos, echoes, and shadows.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Since all relations are objects, and all objects are formed in turn of a swarming internal empire of relations, the basic model of the world that results is both simple and endlessly pluralistic: namely, nothing exists but the interiors of objects, since objects are nothing but their interiors.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><h3>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/march-5th-2021">March 5th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote>If every object is a vacuum, it is equally true that every vacuum must contain a world‚Äîa medium in which distinct qualities interact or at least float side-by-side in some sort of charged ether.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>In astrophysics, Lee Smolin has theorized that every black hole contains an entire universe of its own. By analogy, we might say that every object is not only protected by a vacuous shield from the things that lie outside it, but also harbors and nurses an erupting infernal universe within.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section><section><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/february-28th-2021">February 28th, 2021</a></h3><div><p>In <a class="ref" href="/books/guerrilla-metaphysics"> Guerrilla Metaphysics</a>, <a class="ref" href="/topics/graham-harman">Graham Harman</a> makes a big deal of <a class="ref" href="/topics/metaphor">Metaphor</a>.
