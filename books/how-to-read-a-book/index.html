All of our normal reading habits are opposed to this.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Not only must we resolutely refuse to accept the terminology of any one author; we must also be willing to face the possibility that no authorâ€™s terminology will be useful to us.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Syntopical reading, in short, is to a large extent an exercise in translation. We do not have to translate from one natural language to another, as from French to English. But we do impose a common terminology on a number of authors who, whatever natural language they may have shared in common, may not have been specifically concerned with the problem we are trying to solve, and therefore may not have created the ideal terminology for dealing with it.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>STEP 3 IN SYNTOPICAL READING: GETTING THE QUESTIONS CLEAR.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>STEP 4 IN SYNTOPICAL READING: DEFINING THE ISSUES.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>STEP 5 IN SYNTOPICAL READING: ANALYZING THE DISCUSSION.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The truth, then, insofar as it can be foundâ€”the solution to the problem, insofar as that is available to usâ€”consists rather in the ordered discussion itself than in any set of propositions or assertions about it.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>This is another way of saying that the aim of a project of syntopical reading is not final answers to the questions that are developed in the course of it, or the final solution of the problem with which the project began.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>the conscientious syntopical reader may resort to one obvious device and use it as much as possible. That is, he must constantly refer back to the actual text of his authors,</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section></article></html>
