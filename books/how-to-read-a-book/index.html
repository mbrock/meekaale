All of our normal reading habits are opposed to this.</blockquote><blockquote>Not only must we resolutely refuse to accept the terminology of any one author; we must also be willing to face the possibility that no author’s terminology will be useful to us.</blockquote><blockquote>Syntopical reading, in short, is to a large extent an exercise in translation.

That is, he must constantly refer back to the actual text of his authors,</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
