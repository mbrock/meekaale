All of our normal reading habits are opposed to this.</blockquote><blockquote id="IALW7eGL4">Not only must we resolutely refuse to accept the terminology of any one author; we must also be willing to face the possibility that no author‚Äôs terminology will be useful to us.</blockquote><blockquote id="Mqwqq6lg_">Syntopical reading, in short, is to a large extent an exercise in translation. We do not have to translate from one natural language to another, as from French to English. But we do impose a common terminology on a number of authors who, whatever natural language they may have shared in common, may not have been specifically concerned with the problem we are trying to solve, and therefore may not have created the ideal terminology for dealing with it.</blockquote><blockquote id="VwQzVwB6h">STEP 3 IN SYNTOPICAL READING: GETTING THE QUESTIONS CLEAR.</blockquote><blockquote id="S-ObOcbBg">STEP 4 IN SYNTOPICAL READING: DEFINING THE ISSUES.</blockquote><blockquote id="5i9hwDRtw">STEP 5 IN SYNTOPICAL READING: ANALYZING THE DISCUSSION.</blockquote><blockquote id="JgO9NYaW1">The truth, then, insofar as it can be found‚Äîthe solution to the problem, insofar as that is available to us‚Äîconsists rather in the ordered discussion itself than in any set of propositions or assertions about it.</blockquote><blockquote id="uSEkj_0UX">This is another way of saying that the aim of a project of syntopical reading is not final answers to the questions that are developed in the course of it, or the final solution of the problem with which the project began.</blockquote><blockquote id="LzQsYF7v2">the conscientious syntopical reader may resort to one obvious device and use it as much as possible.
