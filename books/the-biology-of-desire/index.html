Thus, addiction develops‚Äîit‚Äôs learned‚Äîbut it‚Äôs learned more deeply and often more quickly than most other habits, due to a narrowing tunnel of attention and attraction.</blockquote><blockquote id="PAuVg4HlW">As with other developing habits, this process is grounded in a neurochemical feedback loop that‚Äôs present in all normal brains. But it cycles more persistently because of the frequent recurrence of desire and the shrinking range of what is desired.</blockquote><blockquote id="op_UZgyZw">Addiction arises from the same feelings that bind lovers to each other and children to their parents. And it builds on the same cognitive mechanisms that get us to value short-term gains over long-term benefits.</blockquote><blockquote id="AottE3m9h">Medical researchers are correct that the brain changes with addiction. But the way it changes has to do with learning and development‚Äînot disease.</blockquote><blockquote id="LJ0Cqghcp">Addiction can therefore be seen as a developmental cascade, often foreshadowed by difficulties in childhood, always boosted by the narrowing of perspective with recurrent cycles of acquisition and loss.</blockquote><blockquote id="6X-oP85BW">Addiction is a habit, which, like many other habits, gets entrenched through a decrease in self-control.</blockquote><blockquote id="PbVPKISlq">Each rewarding experience builds its own network of synapses in and around the striatum (and OFC), and those networks continue to draw dopamine from its reservoir in the midbrain. That‚Äôs true of Paris, romance, football, and heroin. As we anticipate and live through these experiences, each network of synapses is strengthened and refined, so the uptake of dopamine gets more selective as rewards are identified and habits established.</blockquote><blockquote id="2_ED1nmFO">Thus, love and addiction are characterized by many of the same psychological and neural features. In fact, these authors use the phrase ‚Äúpartner addiction,‚Äù and that certainly seems accurate for many couples. Conversely, people who have struggled with substance addiction often describe their attraction to a particular substance as feeling like being in love.</blockquote></div><h3 id="JReJHfSpJ">Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-26">March 26th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote id="ke0Lop_aJ">When our experience of the world is fraught with strong feelings‚Äîwhether of attraction, threat, pleasure, or relief‚Äîbrain change takes on extra momentum. What drives this momentum? Emotions focus our attention and our thinking, and particular emotions (in response to something) call up particular thoughts and behaviours, thereby fuelling the same feedback cycle every time that something is encountered. When those emotions recur over and over, with each repetition of the feedback cycle, our overly focused brains inevitably change in a particular direction, entrenching a certain emotional experience a little more each time. Most relevant to addiction, the feeling of desire for something specific shapes the brain more acutely than other feelings. As you will see, desire-laced experiences mould the brain into a vehicle for creating similar experiences, also rooted in desire, for a long time to come.</blockquote><blockquote id="gMdnLRrxD">People have referred to addiction as a habit throughout recent history. That‚Äôs just what it is. It‚Äôs a nasty, often relentless habit. A serious habit. An expensive habit. But what makes it so enduring, so relentless, so difficult to change? What makes it different from what we might call more benign habits? Three things. First, it‚Äôs a habit of thinking and feeling‚Äîa mental habit‚Äînot just a behavioural habit. It‚Äôs easier to stop singing in the shower than it is to stop seeing the world as violent or unfair. Second, the feeling part of addiction always includes the feeling of desire, which is of course the theme of this book. And third, it‚Äôs a habit that becomes compulsive‚Äîa topic that will be explored in detail later. Perhaps all habits, once formed, are compulsive to some degree. The brain is certainly built to make any action, repeated enough times, into a compulsion. But the emotional heart of addiction‚Äîin a word, desire‚Äîmakes compulsion inevitable, because unslaked desire is the springboard to repetition, and repetition is the key to compulsion.</blockquote><blockquote id="bze1bqVCX">Like all habits, addiction quite simply grows and stabilizes, in brain tissue that is designed (by evolution) to change and stabilize. Yet addiction belongs to a subset of habits: those that are most difficult to extinguish. To understand addiction, we need to see it as the outcome of a normally functioning brain, not a diseased brain.</blockquote><blockquote id="jaI7azEhe">Plants grow, and so do brains, ecosystems, corporations, and climate patterns. But plants grow along the lines their genes have dictated. Cells divide and follow instructions, so oak trees and tulips look very much like their parents. In contrast, human brains, ecosystems, corporations, and climate patterns grow unpredictably, filling the world with enormous diversity.</blockquote><blockquote id="a6x-YDu4G">If you bite into a piece of chocolate cheesecake and feel a gush of pleasure, and if you‚Äôre left with a lingering desire (which surfaces the next time you eat out), you have begun a trajectory of ‚Äúloving chocolate cheesecake.‚Äù At first, maybe just a few synapses have been altered by such an experience. But those changes increase the chance that you will encounter chocolate cheesecake on a future occasion. You will notice it more, acquire it more, and eat it more. And before long a string of subjective experiences will give rise to a string of neural changes that continue to feed back to the ever more predictable consumption of chocolate cheesecake. Congratulations: you have now developed a habit.</blockquote><blockquote id="ipUb2XdPb">I could summarize who you are, in the simplest terms, by listing your most distinct habits, especially those evoked by negative emotions. Isn‚Äôt that what we do when someone asks us, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he or she like?‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote id="OAgvS6uJj">Neural patterns forged by desire can certainly complement and merge with those born of depression or anxiety. In fact, that‚Äôs an important bridge to the self-medication model of addiction. In his 2010 book, In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, Gabor Mat√© persuasively shows how early emotional disturbances steer us toward the relief that becomes addiction.</blockquote><blockquote id="_PVyYX1Dj">Different experiential feedback loops create different parts of us, based on different brain patterns, like the work of a painter who does one section of a painting, then another, then another, then goes back and works some more on the first. Of course it wouldn‚Äôt be a very good painting if those parts didn‚Äôt hold together with some degree of coherence, and the painter knows this very well. When it comes to human development, we don‚Äôt necessarily believe that there‚Äôs a painter in charge. But there is still a lot of coherence in the end result, and that coherence is often what we call personality.</blockquote><blockquote id="ioTCQsysW">If everything I just described is more or less correct, if this is how humans develop, how they form, then you don‚Äôt need an external cause like ‚Äúdisease‚Äù to explain the growth of bad habits, or even a set of interlocking bad habits (like being a drug addict and a criminal and a liar).</blockquote><blockquote id="kd_OarK5E">Bad habits self-organize like any other habits. Bad habits like addiction grow more deeply and often more quickly than other bad habits, because they result from feedback fuelled by intense desire, and because they crowd out the availability or appeal of alternative pursuits. But they are still, fundamentally, habits‚Äîhabits of thinking, feeling, and acting.</blockquote><blockquote id="J8jYSfQe3">Learning usually requires at least moderately strong emotions, and it is greatly facilitated by repeated experiences (or else one or two extremely powerful experiences). These create the first layer of a new synaptic pattern, a new lattice of synaptic connections. Novel patterns show up as networks‚Äîvillages or towns connected by dozens of little roads. But the networks become more robust and more efficient with repetition, and the learning gets deeper. Think of the dozens of little roads being replaced by several main roads and maybe eventually a freeway.</blockquote><blockquote id="XRw_SNgQD">Your first snort of cocaine probably produced a novel firing pattern. (If not, you‚Äôd have tried a second snort or found another dealer.) Then, each time you (not you personally, of course) snorted coke, more synapses were changed, reinforcing this firing pattern, this ‚Äúcocaine‚Äù configuration. That configuration would soon connect regions all over your brain. These include parts of the cortex‚Äîthe perceptual cortex, in charge of seeing and hearing; the prefrontal cortex, in charge of thinking and planning; and the motor regions, in charge of putting those plans into action. But they also include the limbic regions involved in feelings and motives‚Äîthe amygdala and hippocampus, as well as the striatum (which is not usually defined as ‚Äúlimbic‚Äù per se but . . . close enough). So it‚Äôs more or less the whole brain‚Äîthe parts involved in thought and perception and the parts dedicated to feelings and instincts‚Äîthat gets included in the ‚Äúcocaine‚Äù network. Which is why thoughts, feelings, and action patterns change and crystallize together. To repeat: it‚Äôs the whole brain that programs itself, self-organizes, develops a habit‚Äîa habit that eventually becomes integrated with all your other habits.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
