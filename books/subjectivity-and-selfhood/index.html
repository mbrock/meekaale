My body is given to me as an interiority, a volitional structure, and as a dimension of sensing, but it is also given as a visually and tactually appearing exteriority.</blockquote></div><h3>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-05">March 5th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote>Since intersubjectivity is, in fact, possible, there must exist a bridge between my self-acquaintance and my acquaintance with others; my experience of my own subjectivity must contain an anticipation of the other, must contain the seeds of alterity (Merleau-Ponty 1945, 400-401, 405, 511).</blockquote><blockquote>According to Merleau-Ponty, I can experience others because I am never so close to myself that the other is completely and radically foreign and inaccessible. I am always already a stranger to myself and, therefore, open to others.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
