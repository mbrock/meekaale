Improvisation: The Drama of Christian Ethics is a study of how the church may become a community of trust in order that it may faithfully encounter the unknown of the future without fear.</blockquote><blockquote id="B4KrozkHZ">This is a constructive essay that values the place of the imagination in ethics. It assumes that essential to a notion of the kingdom of God is a perception that things might be different from how they are. In other words, when a community is in Christ, there are no ‚Äúgivens,‚Äù no nonnegotiable facts about existence that one must simply accept, other than the great gift of the gospel</blockquote><blockquote id="v8jKyWkFH">This is whence the church derives its power. It is not constrained by a conventional ‚Äúrealist‚Äù list of ‚Äúgivens‚Äù; it exists in a wonderful moment of possibility, in the Easter moment of resurrection, when all things are possible but not all things, on this side of the eschaton, have yet happened.</blockquote><blockquote id="HI4-JJe_Q">In the incarnation humanity is overwhelmed with the abundance of grace. And in the resurrection God uses what humanity has rejected to save humanity. The first kind describes what in this book I call overaccepting. The second kind describes what in this book I call reincorporation. They are the two most significant practices in improvisation. If they are the way God works in the gospel, should they not be the principal ways in which the church seeks to do likewise? That is the thesis of this book.</blockquote><blockquote id="13tE5VAX5">Aristotle saw humans as political beings. He saw the city-state as the unit of corporate life. Human flourishing lay in the appropriate conduct of these corporate relationships. This is politics. Politics concerns the discovery of common goods that would not have been identifiable without the discussions between people who might otherwise think of themselves as strangers. Politics thus makes possible the art of resolving issues in ways that do not lead to violence. Nonetheless Aristotle regards violence as inevitable too, and the <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>s he commends are ones that are particularly suited to the soldier.</blockquote><blockquote id="tDed5boBC">The people of God were a pilgrim people‚Äîtraveling light, on the move. Jerusalem was no longer the focus of the Promised Land; its temple was no longer the place where sin was forgiven and grace restored. Israel had lived by spatial notions of home and exile. The church was to transform these into temporal notions of past atonement and future reunion.</blockquote><blockquote id="8Py7wgaJy">The drama of the universe ceased to be God‚Äôs unfathomable forces of life, death, and judgment, and the church‚Äôs negotiation of them through the preaching of the biblical narrative and the ministration of the sacraments. Now the center of attention was the human individual, the new self, and the drama was humanity‚Äôs struggle to know and command its environment.</blockquote><blockquote id="hh7c8-mfs">If the center of ethics is the choosing individual, the theories that will prove reasonable and useful are those that make no distinction between persons and treat circumstances and issues regardless of the identities and characters of the people facing them, regardless of notions of overarching providence or everlasting destiny, regardless of the habitual activities of those involved. In this form of argument there may be a valid place for Christianity, as a system and tradition of thought that advocates certain values, but there is little or no place for the church‚Äîfor the church, like all corporate institutions, seems to represent the tradition of external authority, which has been rejected by contemporary ethical thinking.</blockquote><blockquote id="5yWKxANac">These two approaches, the intrinsic (or deontological) and the extrinsic (or consequential), are the two principal forms of ethical argument today. They are the contemporary ‚Äúestablishment,‚Äù the norm in reference to which any other approach must define itself. The former could be called ‚Äúethics for anyone,‚Äù since it sees the individual as a universal category, the principles of whose actions could apply to anyone, anywhere, at any time. The latter could be called ‚Äúethics for everyone,‚Äù since it has a more democratic impulse, looking for outcomes that suit the most people in the most circumstances</blockquote><blockquote id="OvuLJkeH2">Ethics is not about using power, restoring former glory, or fulfilling individual freedom; it is about imitating God, following Christ, being formed by the Spirit to become friends with God.</blockquote><blockquote id="zhXdt-Had">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be fun to watch and see how long the meek can keep the earth after they inherit it.‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote id="y2N6oLnLz">Ecclesial ethics considers that liberation lies not specifically with the articulation and expression of experience but with the traditions and practices of the church and the character and acts of God. This might be called ‚Äúethics for the church.‚Äù This study pursues this third approach.</blockquote><blockquote id="gL2wl3ocG">With the turn to the subject associated with the Enlightenment, it has become more common for theology to be considered as the study of sacred experience‚Äînot necessarily of sacred characters long ago, but particularly of the range of experience accessible to the contemporary heart and mind. And this is the point at which the narrative character of the universal approach begins to emerge.</blockquote><blockquote id="NUxSsltqS">Universal ethics presupposes that there is one story but masks that story in the assumption that it is everybody‚Äôs story. Subversive ethics, by beginning with the experience of exclusion and oppression, points out that this (by no means universal) ideology has an implicit story; that this story is an instrument of domination; and that in fact there are numerous rival stories, representing a host of suppressed parties.</blockquote><blockquote id="t74ag0aXL">Ecclesial ethics has its own definition of theology. It sees the key location of theology as being in the practices of the church. This is only secondarily about a sacred text, sequence of events, or set of doctrines; it is primarily about the formation, development, and renewal of a sacred people.</blockquote><blockquote id="2eQBJqxGq">It is this people, the sacred community, that is the center of ethical reflection. This is what God wants as witness in the world and as companion in the kingdom. This is what Jesus came into the world to embody and gave his life to make possible. This is what the Bible was written to encourage and guide, and this is what theologians are called to resource and challenge.</blockquote><blockquote id="chVX6DUcx">The sacred community is the touchstone of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>. That which builds it up and enables it to be faithful is good and right and true; that which attempts to bypass it or contrives to render it invisible or undermines it from within is dubious, misguided, or dangerous.</blockquote><blockquote id="UGOwmAcoL">The story presupposed by ecclesial ethics is as follows: Israel was called to be a priestly kingdom and a holy nation. Being holy meant being distinctive and being like God. Being priestly meant that other nations would benefit from the ‚Äúministry‚Äù of Israel so long as Israel retained its distinctiveness. God then gave Israel everything it needed to be holy and priestly.</blockquote><blockquote id="95k8QEF0n">Land, king, and temple were lost in the exile, and each was restored only in parody. Though the people returned to the Lord, they were ruled by foreigners. Though there were sometimes kings, there was no return to the tradition of David. Though there was a new temple, there was no ark of the covenant at the heart of it. But during the exile the people‚Äôs sense of what constituted the covenant was renewed, and this renewal provided the space in which God did a new thing for and with them.
Jesus embodied that renewed covenant and redefined land, king, and temple.</blockquote><blockquote id="tUcbAepAj">He directed the people‚Äôs attention to an eschatological horizon beyond the land dominated by the Romans. He pointed out that the second temple had not brought reconciliation with God and spoke of his body as a new temple.</blockquote><blockquote id="sKZbmryJV">In the practices of forming their common life‚Äîincorporating newcomers, maintaining the community, deliberating over its good order, and restoring it when it faced the setbacks of external persecution and internal dissent or weakness‚Äîit was they who, in these practices, were now his body.</blockquote><blockquote id="DOYMRrV68">Christians may begin to confuse the church and the world, trying to make the world the church, or treating it as if it were. If Christians do not have a distinctive community, they will seek prominent positions amongst the powerful in the world. They may well regard it as their responsibility, rather than God‚Äôs, to make the world come out right, to usher in the kingdom. They will therefore need to form a different set of allies, and find themselves with a different set of enemies. This is the danger of ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù ethics.</blockquote><blockquote id="GEMMlZwvx">For the Gnostic, the spiritual quest is an inherently individual matter. The location of theology, if such a term can still be used, lies in the heart and mind of each discrete individual. Human community is secondary, and is valuable only to encourage, resource, or stimulate the individual experience. Other people are more likely to be an obstacle than to be a requirement of fulfillment. Gnosticism consistently bypasses the need for human community and establishes communion with God on grounds that do not require the conversations and compromises and habits of regular contact with other people.</blockquote><blockquote id="aJBFiolNe">A church whose members believe that the true location of theology lies in their own private knowledge and experience is desperately vulnerable.</blockquote><blockquote id="pd4zhWKDt">The individual simply is not strong enough to carry the full weight of theological liberation‚Äîto become the church. Gnosticism delivers the church into captivity‚Äîinto exile.</blockquote><blockquote id="GxX2XS8H9">The unit of ethics is neither the universal world nor the isolated individual but the particular church.</blockquote><blockquote id="HipMBoapU">The Christian story places Christ at the center of meaning and delivers humanity from the agony of meaninglessness, transforming the unavoidable fate of our mortal folly into the glorious destiny of his unending joy.</blockquote><blockquote id="nyx5d6TMv">Individuals are not the location of theological reflection, but they can be the symbols and narrative and sacramental transformation. Their changed lives embody the hope of the community. They are the most visible face of the church, the most public ambassadors of God.</blockquote><blockquote id="E2qF-phjh">Aristotle sought to inspire his readers to be heroes. The virtues he commends are noble ones, and the lives he advocates are ones of effort and attention.</blockquote><blockquote id="NjQAjKpfP">They are formed in the virtues required to negotiate an awesome role: they are prepared to be the center of the story. They stand out from the crowd; they form friendships only with others of similar stature. They are self-sufficient and resilient amid setbacks. The definitive icon of <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a> is the soldier, who is prepared to risk death for the sake of a higher good. The noblest death is death in battle, for battle offers the greatest danger, thus requiring the greatest courage.</blockquote><blockquote id="ysddELz1W">what today‚Äôs readers find most difficult about Aristotle is his assumption that, though everyone would want to be a hero, very few people will be, and that so being requires a Herculean effort of discipline and will. Today‚Äôs readers object to such elitism.</blockquote><blockquote id="fnDqOtb87">Aquinas did not seek to inspire his readers to be heroes. The <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>s he commends are not those that enable his readers to make decisive interventions in the heat of battle or the height of controversy. The <a class="ref" href="/topics/virtue">Virtue</a>s he proposes are those that enable Christians to follow Christ. They are not called to be heroes. They are called to be saints. The word ‚Äúhero‚Äù does not appear in the New Testament. The word ‚Äúsaint‚Äù occurs sixty-four times. What is the difference between a hero and a saint? Five differences present themselves.</blockquote><blockquote id="Tar5Eaxk4">The hero always makes a decisive intervention at a moment when things are looking like they could all go badly wrong. The hero steps up and makes everything turn out right. In other words, the hero is always at the center of the story. By contrast, the saint is not necessarily a crucial character. The saint may be almost invisible, easily missed, quickly forgotten. The hero‚Äôs story is always about the hero. The saint is always at the periphery of a story that is really about God.</blockquote><blockquote id="pb4_a9f3M">The hero‚Äôs strength, courage, wisdom, or great timing‚Äîsuch are the qualities on which the hero‚Äôs decisive intervention rests. By contrast, the saint may well not have any great qualities. The saint may not be strong, brave, clever, or opportunistic. But the saint is faithful. The story of the hero is told to rejoice in valor. The story of the saint is told to celebrate faith.</blockquote><blockquote id="uj3rNQdfP">Love, joy, <a class="ref" href="/topics/peace">Peace</a>, faithfulness, gentleness‚Äîthese do not rise or fall with the stock market.</blockquote><blockquote id="DmrzXZSJS">A hero fears failure, flees mistakes, and knows no repentance; the saint knows that light only comes through cracks, that beauty is as much (if not more) about restoration as about creation.</blockquote><blockquote id="VY8hzcwG0">Of those sixty-four references to saints in the New Testament, every one is in the plural. Saints are never alone</blockquote><blockquote id="O8DdiE93F">If the community of faith is the primary subject of theological ethics, <a class="ref" href="/topics/narrative">Narrative</a> becomes an inadequate category for interpretation.</blockquote><blockquote id="bIWnuZWU7">The narrative‚Äînotwithstanding its many blind alleys, false prophets, unresolved tensions, and inconsistent outcomes‚Äîmay still become a ‚Äúsecret knowledge.‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote id="S0DPES8WF">The theologian who has given most consideration to the notion of theology as drama is Hans Urs von Balthasar. He searches for a genre that does justice to the dialogue between God and humanity, to the interaction between the finite freedom of humankind and the infinite freedom of God, and to the way those dialogues are played out through the reception and rejection of the Word.</blockquote><blockquote id="5xeuQGEW9">The dramatic perspective synthesizes the strengths of the epic and lyric dimensions. Like the lyric, it does justice to the role of the subject, the way that events arise from the hearts and minds and actions of people, rather than from impersonal external forces. Like the epic, it perceives an object that has reason and validity beyond the subjectivity of the involved observer</blockquote><blockquote id="5KOTLuj9N">Von Balthasar‚Äôs notion of drama brings together the internal intentions and dispositions of acting characters with the external events and deeds of the story. Thus he synthesizes the subjectivity of lyric with the objectivity of epic.</blockquote><blockquote id="OoTv5DDDz">Lyric ignores time by reverting to atemporal subjectivity, while epic strives to overcome the contingency of time through imposing an artificial coherence. Drama celebrates and embraces an open and social future</blockquote><blockquote id="shK3TRuSt">While pointing out that it was sin, rather than just sin‚Äôs consequences, that Jesus took on himself and overcame, von Balthasar nonetheless commends Girard‚Äôs project as ‚Äúthe most dramatic‚Äù in contemporary soteriology and theology generally.</blockquote><blockquote id="O_b9FvhSN">What I described as the ‚ÄúGnostic‚Äù temptation can be seen, in the light of the foregoing treatment of von Balthasar, as the temptation to avoid the vicissitudes of time by reverting to inner lyric experience or overarching epic truth. What is needed is a truly dramatic theological ethic, one that incorporates von Balthasar‚Äôs commitment to a synthesis of lyric and epic, while genuinely embracing time as a friend and therefore reinstating the practices of the church and the significance of the present.</blockquote><blockquote id="0GuNiZE3Y">Apocalyptic speculation lends itself to the Gnostic temptation of a secret knowledge that tries to circumvent the contingencies of community and the open-endedness of time through the assurance of a guaranteed ending.</blockquote><blockquote id="YZojy5YJY">What emerges after these four amendments to N.¬†T. Wright‚Äôs model is a revised version of the five-act play. Act One is creation, Act Two is Israel, Act Three is Jesus, Act Four is the church, and Act Five is the eschaton.</blockquote><blockquote id="n7MCeKXM4">The first act is creation. The drama of this act is that there was too much love in the Trinity for God not to share it.</blockquote><blockquote id="rohIMNtJ_">God is the creator, and God is surrounded by creatures. Those creatures do not exist for themselves but have a purpose for God. God made them this way because God wanted one like each of them. Their chief purpose is to glorify and enjoy God forever. And yet these creatures use their freedom for ill</blockquote><blockquote id="LoxXVwu7J">The second act is Israel. God longed to be in true relationship with creation through the part of creation that apprehended the divine glory‚Äîhumankind. The prologue to Genesis describes how this failed in Adam and failed again at Babel. So God called Abraham, and Abraham followed. The rest of the Old Testament is a love story in which Israel strives with God, unable to live with God and unable to live without God.</blockquote><blockquote id="6B08fb8ob">Here is the drama, the wrestling of the story: can Israel find the forms of life that honor its call to be holy? How will God woo or wrest Israel back when Israel strays? How far is too far to stray? Will God save the nations another way?</blockquote><blockquote id="-YEeTE1Ze">The third act is Jesus. This is the definitive act, at the center of the drama, in which God‚Äôs character is revealed; the author enters the drama.</blockquote><blockquote id="c-jQ19MM2">Christians are in Act Four, the church. Israel thought it was in a three-act play, creation‚ÄîIsrael‚ÄîMessiah, and the shock was that when Jesus came he neither restored political authority nor brought the story to an end. Instead, he inaugurated Act Four. In this act, the church is given all it needs to continue to be his body in the world.</blockquote><blockquote id="bykjb2DUg">Still to come is Act Five, the end (or eschaton). This is a frightening thing for those who have built up power and resources, but for those who have nothing to lose, it is unbounded joy.</blockquote><blockquote id="Qozrha1z1">The face on the cross is the face on the throne.</blockquote><blockquote id="HvDfM1TTb">The myth of human fulfillment, the stretching of human capacity to its utmost and the filling up of the resultant space with experience and reward, means everything must be squeezed into the unforgiving span of a single life. The five-act drama, in its epic dimensions, means that Christians are spared such a crisis. They are not called to be effective or successful, but to be faithful.</blockquote><blockquote id="aM7Q2PbrH">Christians can afford to fail, because they trust in Christ‚Äôs victory and in God‚Äôs ultimate sovereignty. Their faithful failures point all the more to their faith in their story and its author.</blockquote><blockquote id="iJLMpFuEh">On the great debating points of church order, people talk as if Jesus and the early church lived an eternity ago and set everything in stone. But what if Jesus lives today and the church still has thousands or millions of years ahead of it?</blockquote><blockquote id="A6qLyDGRC">The mistake of assuming one is in Act Two is to behave as though the Messiah has not yet come. Yes, one is a member of a special people, called by God, but no, God has not yet revealed the definitive divine way of encountering people and moving in the world. Thus one can be moved to sacrifice others, or oneself, in order to change things rather than recognize that Christ has made the sacrifice instead.</blockquote><blockquote id="9H47R86Hg">To take on the role of Jesus, rather than enjoy being a disciple in Act Four, is to assume one lives in Act Three. This point of view is always fashionable‚Äîeveryone likes to think they live in significant times. But the shape of the five-act play reminds the church that it does not live in particularly significant times. The most important things have already happened.</blockquote><blockquote id="EyKdVKV1C">In baptism, Christians are taken into a drama, where God has created them and others for a purpose, where Israel has answered a call and pursued a vocation, where Jesus has become one like them and has conquered sin and death, where the Spirit has empowered the church to follow Christ, and where God will end the drama in the fullness of time. Christians find their character by becoming a character in God‚Äôs story. They move from trying to realize all meaning in their own lives to receiving the heritage of faith and the hope of glory. They move from fearing their fate to singing of their destiny. For this is the effect of God‚Äôs story: it transforms fate into destiny.</blockquote><blockquote id="a9DgOED1a">In the performance of a play there must always be an element of creativity that enables the performers to make the text a living event.</blockquote><blockquote id="0bF4gvd5K">‚ÄúWe would do ourselves a disservice if we understood the incommunicative, affective engagement in the drama as merely a back door entry into the sobriety of cognition.‚Äù13</blockquote><blockquote id="wtkRBwO94">‚ÄúTheatrical performance, like Christian practice, has a script, is communal, is done in dialogue with society, employs a variety of methods and of media, and is embodied.‚Äù14</blockquote><blockquote id="6lhy2j-1S">Performance does justice to the embodied, communal way in which the church tries to involve itself in the life enjoined by the Scripture while remaining faithful to the character of God that emerges from the biblical witness. However, the notion of discipleship as the performance of a script has significant drawbacks, and I shall briefly highlight four of them.</blockquote><blockquote id="TYwKZ6iuL">If performance of a script is regarded as the paradigmatic form of discipleship, a great deal of disappointment or doublethink is likely to result. It cannot simply be a matter of performing the same story in new circumstances. The story must make some allowance for the new circumstances.</blockquote><blockquote id="cpiAhmtx9">A third course is to seek to translate the script into contemporary motifs. This is generally done in an effort to save the notion of tradition in the face of the tendency to dismiss the script altogether. What invariably happens is that the narrative character of the drama gets lost. In its place comes a number of abstractions, sometimes taken to be a middle course between scriptural witness and secular experience or wisdom. These can easily result in the focus of the drama moving away from the church, its practices, and its interaction with the world, and moving instead toward either the faceless forces of social formation, such as markets, arms, and communication systems, or the privatized interiority of personal decision-making.</blockquote><blockquote id="zA5tp5uNC">The nineteenth-century essayist J.¬†A. Froude described his experience of modernity in these terms: ‚ÄúThus all round us, the intellectual lightships had broken from their moorings, and it was then a new and trying experience. The present generation which has grown up in an open spiritual ocean, which has got used to it and has learned to swim for itself, will never know what it was to find the lights all drifting, the compasses all awry, and nothing left to steer by except the stars.‚Äù18</blockquote><blockquote id="4t_-6bEgU">The longing is for the epic security of the anchor and the lyric intensity of the stars. But instead they find that they are alone and bewildered, free from the moorings that generations ago provided a structure to life; and moreover the sea is rough, and refuge is hard to find.</blockquote><blockquote id="izO5nuo-H">How can the church continue to be faithful without the reassurance of the script? This is the central question that pervades my whole inquiry. I have considered performance, but that, while allowing for the ‚Äúspaces between the words,‚Äù is still tied to the script. I have glanced at rehearsal, but that, while offering a still looser form, continues to presuppose a fixed script. It is not that the text of Scripture is not, or should not be, fixed. It is that there is a dimension of Christian life that requires more than repetition, more even than interpretation‚Äîbut not so much as origination, or creation de novo. That dimension, the key to abiding faithfulness, is improvisation.</blockquote><blockquote id="MDX3sl6z4">When improvisers are trained to work in the theater, they are schooled in a tradition so thoroughly that they learn to act from habit in ways appropriate to the circumstance. This is exactly the goal of theological ethics.</blockquote><blockquote id="EblAaFpyT">Improvisation is concerned with discernment. It is about hearing God speak through renewed practice and attending to the Spirit through trained listening. It is corporate, since it is concerned with a group of people acting and reflecting like a theatrical company. It is concerned with engaging with the world.</blockquote><blockquote id="7o4U6oRVS">In terms of theatrical improvisation, every actor must learn to avoid trying to be original. Few things paralyze action more than one actor refusing to engage unless he or she is able to do so in an original way. The only way it is possible to keep the drama going is to be obvious.</blockquote><blockquote id="gkjXoL5kx">If Christians live in the fourth act of a five-act play, they have permission to improvise‚Äîas saints. They have no need to make everything come right, nor have they need to correct perceived shortcomings in any of the previous three acts. They simply use the resources of the first three acts, and what they anticipate of the final act, and faithfully play with the circumstances in which they find themselves.</blockquote><blockquote id="pPZCCZwFt">The community of disciples that has been formed in the habits of the Christian story has all its attention on the surprises God will bring. It is not racked with anxiety about what inspired thing it must now do.</blockquote><blockquote id="YN3EHkRSJ">Improvisation is not about outstandingly gifted individuals who can conjure rapid-fire gags from a standing start. It is about nurturing a group of people to have such trust in one another that they have a high level of common understanding and take the same things for granted.</blockquote><blockquote id="EuouBC2te">For the improviser, the unconscious is not to be feared as a dark realm of dangerous instinct and forbidden <a class="ref" href="/topics/desire">Desire</a>. It is instead to be trusted as a gift of God that can, like all other aspects of the baptized person, be transformed and conformed to the service of God.</blockquote><blockquote id="xCnNswj_w">By articulating the unconscious, improvisation opens the Christian community up to grace: it does not bury its unknown gift, but trades with it, and thus comes to know it, and to trust God to forgive and heal it when necessary.</blockquote><blockquote id="S2NSx-_X7">Throughout the Christian drama there is joy and playfulness that arise in human and divine communion. It is inherent in Act One‚Äîthe play of creation, the desire for Adam not to be alone. It is there in Act Two‚Äîthe dance of David before the Lord, the irony and humor of a host of narratives. It is there in Act Three, as a company of disciples are found, follow, consistently and then definitively lose the plot, only to be found new roles again in a restored company. And it is there in Act Five, as vindicated victims take their seat at the banqueting table and their place in the heavenly choir. So why not in Act Four? The church can afford to concentrate on details, because God has given her time to follow him. Taking time for the trivial is therefore a sign of faith, not foolishness.</blockquote><blockquote id="l5JEFd2eu">Free from the paralysis of being original, the pressure to be clever, the fear of the unconscious, and the demand to be solemn, the church can faithfully follow its Lord by improvising in the fourth act. Happy to be obvious, relaxed, open to the unconscious, and playful, improvising transforms the Bible from a script that needs performing into a manual that trains disciples to take the right things for granted. No longer need Christian communities anxiously glance over their shoulder, lest they make a terrible mistake that betrays their performance of the script. Instead they can trust the practices and patterns of their common life and have confidence that God joins their faithful improvisation.</blockquote><blockquote id="uZYAXd3RX">Each may respectively be seen as any of the three (stage, players, and audience), or all, at different times. These reversals and interplays of expectation and custom are the stuff of improvisation.</blockquote><blockquote id="3eBuUJgho">Contemporary ethics seems to offer a series of baffling dilemmas. The moral life seems to be an impossible negotiation of hopeless quandaries. Why is this?</blockquote><blockquote id="Clog-TWe6">Ethics has become the study of the battlefield without much recognition of the training ground. This has happened because ethics has come to be understood as the study of what is right always, everywhere, and for everybody. In other words, ethics considers what all people have in common, not the areas where they differ.</blockquote><blockquote id="lPTttroBu">The heart of ethics lies in the formation of character. Once out in the ‚Äúbattlefield,‚Äù it is too late.</blockquote><blockquote id="ea1cLzizw">Ethics is not primarily about the operating theater; it is about the lecture theater, the training field, the practice hall, the library, the tutorial, the mentoring session.</blockquote><blockquote id="0jvT8J9fP">In every moral ‚Äúsituation,‚Äù the real decisions are ones that have been made some time before.</blockquote><blockquote id="-W9QH93bv">The moral life should not be experienced as an agony of impossible choice. Instead, it should be a matter of habit and instinct. Learning to live well is about gaining the right habits and instincts, rather than making the right choices.</blockquote><blockquote id="pn2Eajo-9">Forming the right kinds of instincts is really about developing the imagination.</blockquote><blockquote id="c2r_Heg-o">One may distinguish two kinds of imagination, rather as one may distinguish between habit and effort. There is the imagination that one uses in one‚Äôs ordinary perception of the world. This ‚Äúordinary‚Äù imagination enables one to take for granted those things that one needs to be able to rely on. But there is also the imagination that is inventive and revolutionary, perceiving objects as <a class="ref" href="/topics/symbol">Symbol</a> of things beyond themselves. This latter, ‚Äúcreative‚Äù dimension is described by one Christian philosopher as the ability ‚Äúto see simultaneously what is and what might yet be for the best, to engage at the same time the most creative of human passions, and consequently to lure into action and to sustain commitment.‚Äù4</blockquote><blockquote id="TLVlqsYeu">When the crisis of ethics, the time for acute moral effort, is understood to be the moment of decision, and when ethics itself is understood as the balancing of moral principles so as to adjudicate tricky cases of conscience, the result is implicitly socially conservative.

For Cavanaugh, this is based on a misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of torture. For torture is not primarily an attack on individual bodies. Individual bodies suffer great pain and distress, but the purpose of torture is the disintegration of social bodies. ‚ÄúTorture is not merely an attack on, but the creation of, individual bodies.‚Äù16</blockquote><blockquote id="5oitx60VS">Torture is an extreme version of the process common to modernity, of the state dismantling intermediate social bonds in the name of giving individuals equality under the law, with the result that none of the ties and bonds by which medieval persons identified themselves any longer hold sway.</blockquote><blockquote id="WJ4jFNtMQ">Cavanaugh‚Äôs argument makes it painfully clear that the disappearance of the church (following Pius XI and Jacques Maritain‚Äôs ecclesiology) was related to the disappearance of bodies in torture.

What is required of the church therefore is to reassert itself as a body in its own right. The church‚Äôs response to torture is not to campaign for individual rights, because the notion of individual rights colludes with the assumption that the individual is at the mercy of the state. Instead, the church needs nothing less than to remember and demonstrate that it is the true body, a body more significant than either individual or state, a body entered in baptism and shaped by the Eucharist.

Christians become a gift to be given away to others, as illustrated in the practices of the Vicaria and the Sebastian Acevedo Movement.
