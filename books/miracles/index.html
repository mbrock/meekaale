And if that is what we mean by Nature, then of course nothing else exists.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Nature means what happens â€˜of itselfâ€™ or â€˜of its own accordâ€™: what you do not need to labour for; what you will get if you take no measures to stop it. The Greek word for Nature (Physis) is connected with the Greek verb for â€˜to growâ€™; Latin Natura, with the verb â€˜to be bornâ€™. The Natural is what springs up, or comes forth, or arrives, or goes on, of its own accord: the given, what is there already: the spontaneous, the unintended, the unsolicited.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>What the Naturalist believes is that the ultimate Fact, the thing you canâ€™t go behind, is a vast process in space and time which is going on of its own accord. Inside that total system every particular event (such as your sitting reading this book) happens because some other event has happened; in the long run, because the Total Event is happening.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The Naturalist believes that a great process, of â€˜becomingâ€™, exists â€˜on its ownâ€™ in space and time, and that nothing else existsâ€”what we call particular things and events being only the parts into which we analyse the great process or the shapes which that process takes at given moments and given points in space. This single, total reality he calls Nature.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The Supernaturalist believes that one Thing exists on its own and has produced the framework of space and time and the procession of systematically connected events which fill them. This framework, and this filling, he calls Nature.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>If we decide that Nature is not the only thing there is, then we cannot say in advance whether she is safe from miracles or not. There are things outside her: we do not yet know whether they can get in.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Now it will be noticed that if this theory is true we have really admitted something other than Nature. If the movements of the individual units are events â€˜on their ownâ€™, events which do not interlock with all other events, then these movements are not part of Nature.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>would be, indeed, too great a shock to our habits to describe them as super-natural. I think we should have to call them sub-natural. But all our confidence that Nature has no doors, and no reality outside herself for doors to open on, would have disappeared.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Thus a strict materialism refutes itself for the reason given long ago by Professor Haldane: â€˜If my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain, I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true â€¦ and hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms.â€™</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section></article></html>
