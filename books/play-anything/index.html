And once you do, youâ€™ll see them everywhere. And once you see them, you can practice using them, ratcheting up the skill with which you identify and manipulate all the other <a class="ref" href="/topics/playground">Playground</a>s youâ€™ll discover subsequently.</blockquote><blockquote id="E8BYkAi4D">A form of black magic is at work in games and play, the activities we most frequently attach to fun. We know they have power over people, but we canâ€™t quite characterize that power, which makes it all the more tempting to find a way to control it.</blockquote><blockquote id="-xZ-JG33n">Play is not only fun, not only a childâ€™s activity, but also exploring the free movement present in a system of any kind, where system might refer to a social situation as much as a machine assembly.</blockquote><blockquote id="q9BYRyCF3">PLAY IS NOT an act of diversion, but the work of working a system, of interacting with the bits of logic within it.</blockquote><blockquote id="Iesp4_eU4">Play entails a paradox: it is an activity of freedom and pleasure and openness and possibility, but it arises from limiting freedoms rather than expanding them. The boundaries of a <a class="ref" href="/topics/playground">Playground</a>, the contents contained within them. Their structures.</blockquote><blockquote id="6_G5hOy5h">Instead of calling everything a game, we should think of everything as playable: capable of being manipulated in an interesting and appealing way within the confines of its constraints.</blockquote><blockquote id="nrZubtKjS">My <a class="ref" href="/topics/home">Home</a> is a delightful <a class="ref" href="/topics/playground">Playground</a> not because itâ€™s large, but because of the variety of things I am able to do with it.</blockquote><blockquote id="tA5lb1Qkd">If you think about Gibsonian affordances in relation to Heideggerian presence-at-hand, the sum of a thingâ€™s affordances represents all of a thingâ€™s possible interactions with all of the other things with which it might interact.</blockquote><blockquote id="UKHG2UhZQ">Once the material conditions of an object or scenario are clearly understood, the permutations of interactionsâ€”all the Gibsonian, real affordances the thing might allowâ€”represent the perspectives or experiences possible in relation to it.</blockquote></div></section><section class="mt-2"><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/2021-02-25">February 25th, 2021</a></h3><div><p>There's <a class="ref" href="/topics/ian-bogost">Ian Bogost</a> and his ontological view of systems, games, and play, inspired by <a class="ref" href="/topics/object-oriented-ontology">Object-Oriented Ontology</a>.
