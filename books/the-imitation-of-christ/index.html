If you knew the whole Bible by heart and the sayings of all the philosophers, what good would it all be without God‚Äôs love and grace? Vanity of vanities and all is vanity, except to love God and to serve only him.</blockquote><blockquote id="t9nrMvWwj">This is the highest wisdom: to see the world as it truly is, fallen and fleeting; to love the world not for its own sake, but for God‚Äôs; and to direct all your effort toward achieving the kingdom of heaven.</blockquote><blockquote id="SDYn9qXTv">Often remember that saying: ‚ÄúThe eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor is the ear filled with hearing.‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote id="6DRMdwoAV">Of Having a Humble Opinion about Yourself</blockquote><blockquote id="hKMLw7opE">Everyone naturally wishes to have knowledge, but what good is great learning unless it is accompanied by a feeling of deep awe and profound reverence toward God? Indeed, a humble farmer who serves God is better than a proud philosopher, who, neglecting himself, contemplates the course of the heavens.</blockquote><blockquote id="ASNkNiIEF">Calm that excessive thirst for knowledge, for there is great discord and deception in it.</blockquote><blockquote id="Nla0Al1mO">Endless reading and talk do not satisfy the soul, but a good life puts the mind at rest, and a clean conscience brings great confidence in God.</blockquote><blockquote id="Jk-DTr6_G">The more you know and the better you know it, the greater is your responsibility for using your knowledge wisely.</blockquote><blockquote id="QoUx94eu8">So, do not think highly of yourself because of what you know about any art or science, but rather respect the knowledge that has been entrusted to you.</blockquote><blockquote id="k_akElZrJ">If you want to learn something that will really help you, learn to see yourself as God sees you and not as you see yourself in the distorted mirror of your own self-importance.</blockquote><blockquote id="rqMpm0zK5">Of the Teaching of Truth</blockquote><blockquote id="7byQM_DpP">Our opinions and our understanding often lead us astray and offer us very little insight. What good is a brilliant argument about hidden and obscure matters when God does not judge us by our knowledge of such things?</blockquote><blockquote id="YikBR4Uea">O God, the Truth, make me one with you in endless love! I am often worn out by all that I read and hear; you are all that I want or desire. Let all teachers hold their peace.</blockquote><blockquote id="329gQEVA5">A pure, simple and steady spirit is not distracted by flitting about from one thing to another, for he does all things to the honor of God and tries in his heart to be free from all selfishness.</blockquote><blockquote id="vUDcAe_Vi">Knowledge is not to be blamed, nor is the simple understanding of anything which is good in itself and which is made to be so by God, but a good conscience and a virtuous life are always to be put first.</blockquote><blockquote id="NomH6GdAk">Surely, when the day of judgment comes we shall not be asked what we have read but what we have done, not how well we have spoken but how devoutly we have lived.</blockquote><blockquote id="MIn46jRMT">Oh, how swiftly the glory of the world passes away! If only their lives had been in harmony with their learning, then all their studying and reading would have been worthwhile.</blockquote><blockquote id="3D8Tyi-WG">Of Thinking Before You Act</blockquote><blockquote id="RlCaUL7lG">We should not trust every word that we hear or every feeling in our hearts; rather, we should bring such matters before God and carefully ponder them at our leisure.</blockquote><blockquote id="87M7uD4Pp">Instead of following your own notions, consult someone who is wise and conscientious, and seek to be guided by one who is better than yourself.</blockquote><blockquote id="Bg2FHh76I">Of Reading of Holy Writings</blockquote><blockquote id="mjzPLzM-P">We should read devout and simple books as willingly as we read those that are lofty and profound.</blockquote><blockquote id="6F4e0tilT">If you wish to profit from your reading, read with <a class="ref" href="/topics/humility">Humility</a>, simplicity and faith, and do not try to impress others with your great learning.</blockquote><blockquote id="Q6LsmpiXW">Of Confused Feelings</blockquote><blockquote id="6CDCm4JhB">Whenever a person becomes obsessed with success and material things, he quickly becomes restless.</blockquote><blockquote id="xqgEEcGmd">A person who is weak in spirit and who is still controlled by his need to be important has great trouble dragging himself away from the things that most attract him in this world. Such a person is unhappy when he does restrain himself, yet his anger flares up if anyone stands in his way. What is more, if he does get what he wants, he is at once stricken by a heavy conscience because he has given in to his weakness.</blockquote><blockquote id="0V7DzjPoL">Of Avoiding Empty Hope and Self-Praise</blockquote><blockquote id="uAmS1E3FP">Do not be ashamed to serve others for the love of Jesus Christ and to appear poor in this world.</blockquote><blockquote id="tWJpwgeGs">Do not be pleased with yourself about your ability or talent, lest you displease God, from whom comes the sum of whatever natural good you have.</blockquote><blockquote id="prKtMasZw">Do not be proud of your good deeds, for God‚Äôs judgments differ from ours, and he is often displeased by what pleases us.</blockquote><blockquote id="_SGh0qVdD">A person who is humble is always at peace, but a proud person carries a heart filled with envy and resentment.</blockquote><blockquote id="6IFydGXmK">Of Avoiding Inappropriate Intimacy</blockquote><blockquote id="OSEOcsXmH">Do not spend much time with young people or strangers; instead, develop the friendships you have, especially with those who are older and wiser than you are.</blockquote><blockquote id="H84rhD6z1">Of Finding Peace and Making Spiritual Progress</blockquote></div></section><section class="references"><h1 class="semibold mb-1">Incoming Links</h1><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/2021-03-23">March 23rd, 2021</a></h3><div><p>I've been reading some Christian books.
