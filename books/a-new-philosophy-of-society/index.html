In its least sophisticated form this stumbling-block involves making a superficial analogy between society and the human body, and to postulate that just as bodily organs work together for the organism as a whole, so the function of social institutions is to work in harmony for the benefit of society.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The basic concept in this theory is what we may call relations of interiority: the component parts are constituted by the very relations they have to other parts in the whole.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Allowing the possibility of complex interactions between component parts is crucial to define mechanisms of emergence, but this possibility disappears if the parts are fused together into a seamless web. Thus, what needs to be challenged is the very idea of relations of interiority.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Today, the main theoretical alternative to organic totalities is what the philosopher Gilles Deleuze calls assemblages, wholes characterized by relations of exteriority.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section><section><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/march-5th-2021">March 5th, 2021</a></h3><div><p>From <a class="ref" href="/books/a-new-philosophy-of-society"> A New Philosophy of Society</a>:</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
