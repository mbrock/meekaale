And yet—I will argue—it is a fact of life that people act not only from, but also, at other times, for the sake of acquiring, knowledge of value.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The word “proleptic” refers, usually in a grammatical context, to something taken in advance of its rightful place.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Proleptic reasons are provisional in a way that reflects the provisionality of the agent’s own knowledge and development: her inchoate, anticipatory, and indirect grasp of some good she is trying to know better.

The reason for doing that work is provided by the value in question, but the defect in your grasp of that value also shapes the character of the activity it motivates.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>I call this kind of rationality “proleptic.” The word “proleptic” refers, usually in a grammatical context, to something taken in advance of its rightful place. I appropriate it for moral psychology on the model of Margaret Little’s phrase “proleptic engagement” (2008: 342), by which she refers to an interaction with a child in which we treat her as though she were the adult we want her to become.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Proleptic reasons are provisional in a way that reflects the provisionality of the agent’s own knowledge and development: her inchoate, anticipatory, and indirect grasp of some good she is trying to know better. Proleptic reasons allow you to be rational even when you know that your reasons aren’t exactly the right ones.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><h3>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/november-30th-2020">November 30th, 2020</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote>The aspirational account of self-creation offers us a recognizable story of what it is like to actively acquire values and avoids the paradoxes and problems associated with trying to force our understanding of that transition into the mold of self-endorsement or self-cultivation.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The opponent of <a class="ref" href="/topics/teleology">Teleology</a> may suspect that I am invoking something like backward causation or time travel: the future cannot cause the past, so how can something that is in the future have an effect on what I am doing now?</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>My claim, then, is that in the case of aspiration, causal or temporal priority fails to track normative priority. Is this possible? I am inclined to think it must be, since it is actual.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The theorist of aspiration gives us what is the only way to account for self-creation in the face of Strawson’s dilemma; and self-creation is a fact of life.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><h3>Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/december-18th-2020">December 18th, 2020</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote>The reader has probably noticed that the posture of this book is a defensive one.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>But I do all of that by way of making the case that there is, really, such a thing as aspiration. Did this argument need to be made?</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>Does any philosopher deny the existence of the phenomenon that this book champions? Yes, I believe many do, without having drawn their own, or their readers’, attention to that fact.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>For they are moved to describe the relevant set of cases in distorting ways, under the pressure of a theory that has implicitly foreclosed the possibility of the distinctively practical form of learning—value-learning—that constitutes the agency of the aspirant.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>To see no space between self-cultivation and being changed just is to deny the phenomenon of aspiration.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section></article></html>
