In this way refrigerators become identified with (are ‚Äúmodeled‚Äù as) refrigerator serial numbers; persons are identified with social security numbers. The following definition of ‚Äútelephone‚Äù was proposed within the Health Level 7 (HL7) community in 2007: ‚ÄúTelephone: a telephone is an observation with a value having datatype ‚ÄòTelecom.‚Äô‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote id="MgNhO2HUE">What do all the entities that a term such as ‚Äúeukaryote cell‚Äù refers to have in common that makes them together form a type or universal?21 Our preferred answer to this question, which we call ontological realism, says that there is some eukaryote cell universal of which all particular eukaryote cells are instances. On this view, universals are entities in reality that are responsible for the structure, order, and regularity‚Äîthe similarities‚Äîthat are to be found there.</blockquote><blockquote id="c0osA12sg">A class, on our view, is defined as a maximal collection of particulars falling under a given general term.</blockquote><blockquote id="Nl76PsEQd">Each domain ontology consists of a taxonomy (a hierarchy structured by the is_a relation) together with other relations such as part_of, contained_in, adjacent_to, has_agent, preceded_by, and so forth, along with definitions and axioms governing how its terms and relations are to be understood. A domain ontology is thus a taxonomy that has been enhanced to include more information about the universals, classes, and relations that it represents.</blockquote><blockquote id="FzqT2dqAS">What we have called a taxonomy is a representational artifact that is organized hierarchically with nodes representing universals or classes and edges which represent the is_a or subtype relation. Where simple taxonomies are organized in terms of the basic is_a relation only, ontologies are organized also by other relations, such as parthood.</blockquote><blockquote id="NaPhV8XJ7">Indeed, all ontologies, as we understand them here, consist of (1) a central backbone taxonomy, in which all the nodes of the ontology are linked together via is_a relations, together with (2) further relations defined between the nodes of the ontology. In addition, each node consists of (3) a term along with, when necessary, (4) synonyms for the term, and crucially (5) a definition of the term that makes use of the Aristotelian genus and differentia structure.</blockquote><blockquote id="-CYtD4D2b">ontologies are representations of reality, not of people‚Äôs concepts or mental representations or uses of language.</blockquote><blockquote id="c-xogBIDp">Ontological realism applies equally to all branches of science, taking the view that, for example, collateralized debt obligations are no less real than electrons and planets.</blockquote><blockquote id="6pMIyG6po">The implications of perspectivalism for <a class="ref" href="/topics/ontology">Ontology</a> are that the irreducibility of different perspectives should be respected also in the design of ontologies. <a class="ref" href="/topics/ontology">Ontology</a> developers should not seek to represent all portions and features of reality in a single <a class="ref" href="/topics/ontology">Ontology</a>, but should seek, rather, a modular approach, in which each module is maintained as far as possible by experts in the corresponding scientific discipline.</blockquote><blockquote id="o6FlYsoLi">Some specific implications of fallibilism for <a class="ref" href="/topics/ontology">Ontology</a> design in support of scientific research include the following: 3a. That every <a class="ref" href="/topics/ontology">Ontology</a> must have sophisticated strategies for keeping track of successive versions of the <a class="ref" href="/topics/ontology">Ontology</a>.</blockquote><blockquote id="EQcoLc4XP">Adequatism is the opposite tendency, which holds that the entities in any given domain should be taken seriously on their own terms and that room must be made in our set of theories of reality for all of the different sorts of entities that reality contains, at all levels of granularity.</blockquote><blockquote id="M2pNS2wzF">For the adequatist all scientific disciplines are prima facie of equal worth in providing representations of what exists in reality.</blockquote><blockquote id="vA9U7XDHT">A final general principle to keep in mind is the following: when designing a domain <a class="ref" href="/topics/ontology">Ontology</a>, begin by identifying those features of the subject matter that are the easiest and clearest to understand and define.</blockquote><blockquote id="ASRob4LqV">An outline of the steps to be followed in designing a domain ontology 1. Demarcate the subject matter of the ontology. 2. Gather information: identify the general terms used in existing ontologies and in standard textbooks; analyze to remove redundancies. 3. Order these terms in a hierarchy of the more and less general ones. 4. Regiment the result in order to ensure: a. logical, philosophical, and scientific coherence, b. coherence and compatibility with neighboring ontologies, and c. human understandability, especially through the formulation of human-readable definitions. 5. Formalize the regimented representational artifact in a computer usable language in such a way that the result can be implemented in some computable framework.</blockquote><blockquote id="8bBBsBmHl">Avoid as far as possible the use of acronyms and abbreviations in formulating ontology terms. The rationale for this is that acronyms and abbreviations are too easy to create locally‚Äîoften, for example, by designers of databases for no reason other than to enable all column headings to fit on a single screen.</blockquote><blockquote id="EtrBSKhDR">The half-life of acronyms can be very short, and it is not unusual for those who work with databases (even, sometimes, a database‚Äôs own creator) to forget what their acronyms originally meant. The goal of ontology, in contrast, is to create standard terminologies that can be employed and relied upon by anyone‚Äîin the present and in the future‚Äîworking in a given discipline.</blockquote><blockquote id="qs8HcM8bg">And even if only one such use of a mass noun like ‚Äútissue‚Äù were selected as the preferred label in an ontology, the mentioned ambiguities would still lead to problems of misuse of this term by human beings. It is for this reason that we recommend that mass nouns be avoided entirely when constructing ontologies. Instead phrases beginning with an appropriate prefix (such as ‚Äúportion of,‚Äù ‚Äúmaximal portion of,‚Äù and so on) should be adopted.</blockquote><blockquote id="9MMv4yWD_">To achieve this regimentation, we recommend transforming mass nouns such as ‚Äúchemical substance‚Äù into count nouns by attaching ‚Äúportion of‚Äù or some contextually appropriate equivalent operator to the beginning; thus ‚Äúportion of chemical substance,‚Äù ‚Äúportion of tissue,‚Äù and so on. Adopting this strategy makes it possible to treat seeming mass nouns as instances of either fiat parts or object aggregates (see chapter 5). The basic idea though, is that because mass nouns refer to different kinds of entities on different occasions of use, they should be avoided in favor of more ontologically transparent terminology.</blockquote><blockquote id="1Z8ebGFXW">Beginning with the most general types of entities determined by the specific target domain and working downward from there helps to rule out from the beginning the inclusion in the ontology of content that is not relevant to the chosen domain.</blockquote><blockquote id="fe99VWqqB">We recommend in particular that when building ontologies negative terms should be avoided entirely. That is, the ontology builder should assume that the universals are in every case positive, and so terms such as ‚Äúnonrabbit‚Äù or ‚Äúnonheart‚Äù‚Äîdefined in accordance with (*)‚Äîshould not be used, since there are no corresponding negative universals.</blockquote><blockquote id="VXPGMHjNk">Each ontology should incorporate an is_a hierarchy having the structure of a directed acyclical graph with a single root.</blockquote><blockquote id="MAjOG5enC">Our own experience with domain experts who are not ontologists and are building ontologies in a variety of different contexts has taught us repeatedly that, when scientists find it difficult to select between multiple parents for a term needing to be included in an ontology, the discipline imposed by the single inheritance principle is welcomed because it repeatedly leads to greater clarity of thinking on the part of those involved.</blockquote><blockquote id="lebP-m4_y">Examples of object aggregates are a heap of stones, a group of commuters on the subway, a population of bacteria in your blood, a flock of geese, the collection of patients in a hospital.</blockquote><blockquote id="wGYCr7EFT">Examples of specifically dependent continuants include the color of this tomato, the pain in your left elbow, the mass of this cloud, the smell of this piece of mozzarella, the disposition of this fish to decay, your role of being a doctor, the function of your heart to pump blood, and the quality of a specific pixel array on your screen. The mass of this cloud could not exist without this cloud and the color of this tomato could not exist without this tomato.</blockquote><blockquote id="_rluD5MTv">Examples of realizable entity include the role of being a doctor, the functions of the reproductive organs, the disposition of a portion of blood to coagulate, the disposition of a portion of metal to conduct electricity. Entities in each of these types are in each case associated with entities of corresponding process types in which they are realized (executed, manifested, actualized). Thus, for example, the role of a doctor is realized when he examines or treats patients; the function of a reproductive organ is realized in copulation or insemination.</blockquote><blockquote id="LH1Qo3lKb">A role is an externally grounded realizable entity, that is, it is a realizable entity that is possessed by its bearer because of some external circumstances (for example, the bearer has been assigned the role by some other persons, who have roles of their own which grant them a certain authority). A role is thus always optional; the bearer does not have to be in the given external circumstances.</blockquote><blockquote id="4sQDHaDbf">A disposition is a realizable entity in virtue of which‚Äîfor example, through appropriate triggers‚Äîa process of a certain kind occurs (or can occur or is likely to occur) in the independent continuant in which the disposition inheres.</blockquote><blockquote id="H5i_K8kgD">A disposition can thus be conceived of as an internally grounded realizable entity.</blockquote><blockquote id="5R1aHbr8l">Incorporation of dispositions into the BFO ontology provides a means to deal with those aspects of reality that involve possibility or potentiality without the need for complicated appeals to modal logics or possible worlds.</blockquote><blockquote id="2DD8QRaBb">A function is a special kind of disposition.7 It is a realizable entity whose realization is an end-directed activity of its bearer that occurs because this bearer is (a) of a specific kind and (b) in the kind or kinds of contexts that it is made or selected for.</blockquote><blockquote id="SvQ5KfhNI">A BFO: process boundary is an occurrent entity that is the instantaneous temporal boundary of a process.</blockquote></div></section><section class="references"><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/2021-03-16">March 16th, 2021</a></h3><div><p>This is a very plausible reading, but then in Smith's <a class="ref" href="/books/building-ontologies-with-basic-formal-ontology">üìô Building Ontologies With Basic Formal Ontology</a>, we can read:</p><p>I understand Smith's problem with conceptualism from this rather funny paragraph in <a class="ref" href="/books/building-ontologies-with-basic-formal-ontology">üìô Building Ontologies With Basic Formal Ontology</a>:</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
