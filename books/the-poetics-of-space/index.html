The binding principle in this integration is the daydream.</blockquote><blockquote>Before he is “cast into the world,” as claimed by certain hasty metaphysics, man is laid in the cradle of the house.</blockquote><blockquote>Of course, thanks to the house, a great many of our memories are housed, and if the house is a bit elaborate, if it has a cellar and a garret, nooks and corridors, our memories have refuges that are all the more clearly delineated.</blockquote><blockquote>And if we want to determine man’s being, we are never sure of being closer to ourselves if we “withdraw” into ourselves, if we move toward the center of the spiral; for often it is in the heart of being that being is errancy.</blockquote><blockquote>Outside and inside are both intimate—they are always ready to be reversed, to exchange their hostility. If there exists a border-line surface between such an inside and outside, this surface is painful on both sides.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
