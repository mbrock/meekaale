But, they say, the Cartesian intuition that the mental-physical distinction is unbridgeable by empirical means, that a mental state is no more like a disposition than it is like a neuron, and that no scientific discovery can reveal an identity remains. This intuition seems to them enough to establish an unbridgeable gap. But such neo-dualist philosophers are embarrassed by their own conclusions, since although their metaphysical intuitions seem to be Cartesian, they are not clear whether they are entitled to have such things as “metaphysical intuitions.” They tend to be unhappy with the notion of a method of knowing about the world prior to and untouchable by empirical science.</blockquote><blockquote id="04pawtn_I">Nevertheless, the opposite of “mental” is “physical” and the opposite of “immaterial” is “material.” “Physical” and “material” seem synonymous. How can two distinct concepts have synonymous opposites?</blockquote><blockquote id="AZex88Y16">I would hope further to have incited the suspicion that our so-called intuition about what is mental may be merely our readiness to fall in with a specifically philosophical language-game. This is, in fact, the view that I want to defend. I think that this so-called intuition is no more than the ability to command a certain technical vocabulary—one which has no use outside of philosophy books and which links up with no issues in daily life, empirical science, morals, or religion.</blockquote><blockquote id="XdJG9RieF">Why do some neo-dualist philosophers say that how something feels, what it is like to be something, cannot be identical with any physical property, or at least any physical property which we know anything about?</blockquote><blockquote id="HFLZB2McB">I think that the only reply such philosophers have to offer is to point out that in the case of phenomenal properties there is no appearance-reality distinction.</blockquote><blockquote id="kNpPd5EU3">But why should this epistemic distinction reflect an ontological distinction?</blockquote><blockquote id="1yI4maTYI">The world comes divided into things whose nature is exhausted by how they appear and things whose nature is not.</blockquote><blockquote id="GVyX4neUd">The neo-dualist is no longer talking about how people feel but about feelings as little self-subsistent entities, floating free of people in the way in which universals float free of the instantiations. He has, in fact, modeled pains on universals.</blockquote><blockquote id="2bjaIUukG">That special sort of subject of predication whose appearance is its reality—phenomenal pain—turns out to be simply the painfulness of the pain abstracted from the person having the pain. It is, in short, the universal painfulness itself. To put it oxymoronically, mental particulars, unlike mental states of people, turn out to be universals.</blockquote><blockquote id="MHYTtBB9N">Why do we think of the phenomenal as immaterial? We do so because, as Ryle put it, we insist on thinking of having a pain in ocular metaphors—as having a funny sort of particular before the eye of the mind. That particular turns out to be a universal, a quality hypostatized into a subject of predication.</blockquote><blockquote id="ZVtPgkYdP">we have no idea of what a <a class="ref" href="/topics/mind">Mind</a> is save that it is made of whatever universals are made of.</blockquote><blockquote id="KFwxvba4t">In constructing both a Lockean idea and a Platonic Form we go through exactly the same process—we simply lift off a single property from something (the property of being red, or painful, or good) and then treat it as if it itself were a subject of predication, and perhaps also a locus of causal efficacy.</blockquote><blockquote id="RvFyiu2fe">A Platonic Form is merely a property considered in isolation and considered as capable of sustaining causal relations. A phenomenal entity is precisely that as well.</blockquote><blockquote id="uLPuGofuY">Following Wittgenstein, we shall treat the fact that there is no such thing as “a misleading appearance of pain” not as a strange fact about a special ontological genus called the mental, but just as a remark about a language-game—the remark that we have the convention of taking people’s word for what they are feeling.</blockquote><blockquote id="tFEYCUndM">What the patient needs is not a list of his mistakes and confusions but rather an understanding of how he came to make these mistakes and become involved in these confusions.</blockquote><blockquote id="_8wJPh5vA">So far I have, in the customary manner of contemporary philosophers of mind, been flinging around terms like “phenomenal,” “functional,” “intentional,” “spatial” and the like as if these formed the obvious vocabulary in which to discuss the topic. But of course the philosophers who created the language which gave us the mind-body problem did not use this vocabulary, or anything close to it.</blockquote><blockquote id="IZ59gamLQ">Thus we shall not be tempted to think that the possession of an inner life, a stream of consciousness, is relevant to reason.</blockquote><blockquote id="zW-TWgJ12">Once consciousness and reason are separated out in this way, then personhood can be seen for what I claim it is—a matter of decision rather than knowledge, an acceptance of another being into fellowship rather than a recognition of a common essence.</blockquote><blockquote id="PNhO5Hm-m">So even <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>, who spent his life pouring cold water on the metaphysical extravagances of his predecessors, suggests that there probably is something to the notion that the intellect is “separable,” even though nothing else about the soul is.</blockquote><blockquote id="fcZKVoEFg">The metaphor of knowing general truths by internalizing universals, just as the eye of the body knows particulars by internalizing their individual colors and shapes, was, once suggested, sufficiently powerful to become the intellectual’s substitute for the peasant’s belief in life among the shades.</blockquote><blockquote id="FBcSzN8lU">But man, proud man Dressed in a little brief authority Most ignorant of what he’s most assured— His glassy essence—like an angry ape, Plays such fantastic tricks before high Heaven As make the angels weep—who, with our spleens, Would all laugh themselves mortal.</blockquote><blockquote id="_3aR_ob-_">Our Glassy Essence was not a philosophical doctrine, but a picture which literate men found presupposed by every page they read.</blockquote><blockquote id="MffSenW1_">The powers manifested by Achilles were not those of Theaetetus or the Apostles or St. Thomas, but the “intellectual essence” of the scholastics inherited the dualistic notions which gathered force between Homer and Anaxagoras, were given canonical form by Plato, were toned down by <a class="ref" href="/topics/aristotle">Aristotle</a>, and then became entangled (in St. Paul) with a new and determinedly other-worldly religious cult.</blockquote><blockquote id="GmPhupnI0">Recent philosophy of <a class="ref" href="/topics/mind">Mind</a> has tended to lump this vague conglomerate—man’s Glassy Essence—together with the post-Cartesian notions of “consciousness” or “awareness.”</blockquote><blockquote id="B_uMzDVu6">science differed from softer discourse in having “objective reference” to things “out there”</blockquote><blockquote id="Q7XED_d9i">give science what was lacking in religion and politics—the ability to use contact with the real as the touchstone of truth.</blockquote><blockquote id="RMhi0TcLD">It was as if the ability to tell the analytic from the synthetic, and the observational from the theoretical, was all that stood between us and “irrationalism.”</blockquote><blockquote id="bkI0Iwowa">since Kant, philosophy has made it its business to present a permanent neutral framework for culture.</blockquote><blockquote id="TWH_SbN7a">The notions of “philosophical significance” and of “purely philosophical question,” as they are currently used, gained sense only around the time of Kant.</blockquote><blockquote id="bOZAQCn4C">Our post-Kantian sense that epistemology or some successor subject is at the center of philosophy (and that moral philosophy, aesthetics, and social philosophy, for example, are somehow derivative)</blockquote><blockquote id="Et3jvgK7d">To drop the notion of the philosopher as knowing something about knowing which nobody else knows so well would be to drop the notion that his voice always has an overriding claim on the attention of the other participants in the conversation.</blockquote><blockquote id="C3Dg9ZWBY">The useful kibitzing they can provide on the various topics I just mentioned is made possible by their familiarity with the historical background of arguments on similar topics, and, most importantly, by the fact that arguments on such topics are punctuated by stale philosophical clichés which the other participants have stumbled across in their reading, but about which professional philosophers know the pros and cons by heart.</blockquote><blockquote id="t-JdNbUAN">Religion did not come to an end in the Enlightenment, nor painting in Impressionism. Even if the period from Plato to Nietzsche is encapsulated and “distanced” in the way Heidegger suggests, and even if twentieth-century philosophy comes to seem a stage of awkward transitional backing and filling (as sixteenth-century philosophy now seems to us), there will be something called “philosophy” on the other side of the transition.</blockquote><blockquote id="54lHDSAqw">Surely by now they’ve passed beyond Dunkelberg’s dreary absurdities?</blockquote><blockquote id="-N_X5O4EH">A geneticist can, if he takes the trouble, visualize roughly what his colleagues in economics or French literature are trying to do, and what means they employ to do it. They, with a bit more trouble, can do the same for him. But all of them find it much more difficult to do this for their friends in the philosophy department. Such phrases as “a spectator of all time and all eternity” and “the investigation of the being qua being” are appropriate to august and long-dead figures like Plato and Kant, but it’s hard to associate them with young Professor Dimble, who, desperately bucking for tenure, keeps promising to finish his book (entitled “Structure, Interpretation, and Choice: A Linguistic Approach to Value”).</blockquote><blockquote id="MRH_ZQCvH">“the absorption in linguistic trivia of recent Anglo-American philosophy,” the “hysterical irrationalism of postwar European philosophy,” “the fantastic divorce between fact and value, which has crippled philosophy since the Renaissance,” “the worship of mathematics, which has vitiated philosophical speculation since Plato.”</blockquote><blockquote id="JFtMkPxw4">The bafflement felt by the layperson, the fellow academic, and the nonacademic intellectual, if and when they’re confronted with a piece of technical philosophic research, is of a peculiar sort. It is bafflement about aims and about criteria of worth, not simply about particular techniques.</blockquote><blockquote id="s_ArH7eBq">It is not the kind of incomprehension felt when watching a physicist manipulate the controls of a cyclotron, but the kind felt in inspecting an exhibit of what appear to be utterly pointless works of modern art.</blockquote><blockquote id="FDbuJPcyO">The realization that no procedure for judging is available except asking other artists, or professional art critics, sometimes leads us to such paranoid suspicions as “This abstract expressionist stuff is all just a racket.” So it is with Dimble. We know he’s a promising young philosopher because all the other philosophers say he is. But how are we to know that the whole profession isn’t in on the fix?</blockquote><blockquote id="Sc07RM92o">Even if we know nothing of botany, we should shrug off as a crackpot someone who told us that no real botanical research had been done in America for thirty years, and that what was carried on under that name was a fraud and a delusion.</blockquote><blockquote id="kTNf3I2WE">If we do listen with concern to similar announcements about philosophy, it is because philosophy shares with art the character of being “something that everybody ought to think about.”</blockquote><blockquote id="AIXNkf_Dg">It is unfortunate, but it is not inhuman, to know nothing of botany. It is inhuman to simply ignore either art or philosophy, and no one really does.</blockquote><blockquote id="Y3C231rcI">Nor is there anyone who doesn’t feel that “what the philosophers are looking for” is what he himself has known all along, only he “can’t express it.”</blockquote><blockquote id="qQuL7yosv">Half the time we think of philosophy as a quasiscientific discipline—indeed, as scientia scientiarum, the area in which clarity, logical rigor, communicability, and intersubjectivity should reach their acme. The other half of the time we think of philosophizing as a variety of artistic creation, and we think of the philosopher as seer. The first way of thinking leads us to expect teamwork, integrated research, consensus about aims and methods, and agreement about the value of results. The second leads us to expect an occasional extraordinary vision, embodied in the work of some great thinker.</blockquote><blockquote id="BqqEj6Rwo">If philosophy were distinguished from other scientific disciplines simply by subject matter, one could say that simple ignorance of the subject produces the kind of puzzlement we’ve mentioned, and that outsiders should take the time to be systematically trained in philosophy before they start making judgments.</blockquote><blockquote id="48BubrbJI">(Who, even among readers of poetry, would dream of attending a “Poet’s Conference”?)</blockquote><blockquote id="K4qNc0PEc">The tension between philosophy as science and philosophy as vision is as old as the word “philosophy” itself. It was explicit in Plato, and formed one of the principal themes of his dialogues.</blockquote><blockquote id="PypEkgQaO">It is the effort to eliminate this tension that has inspired each of the successive revolutions in philosophical thought—revolutions that are the very stuff of the history of philosophy.</blockquote><blockquote id="5lpk7HEi5">A new philosophy almost invariably announces itself either as making philosophy, at long last, a strict science, or as liberating philosophy, once and for all, from bondage to the methods and forms of scientific thought. Within every such reconstruction of philosophy, however, the familiar tension breaks out anew.</blockquote><blockquote id="GARQbLWt2">Philosophy, as the discipline that asks the largest questions and establishes the most comprehensive schemes of classification, always has the last word.</blockquote><blockquote id="mRHS0poP4">CRITIC (soulfully): Why aren’t you philosophers concerned with the really important things? PHILOSOPHER: How does one know what’s important? CRITIC: But if you don’t even know what’s important, how can you ever decide anything? PHILOSOPHER: That’s just the problem we’re trying to solve. Surely you’d grant that that’s important, wouldn’t you?</blockquote><blockquote id="5xyTttJ6I">The “last” philosophy, could there be such a thing, would not be a philosophy, as we know it, at all: it would be, if it were <a class="ref" href="/topics/intelligible">Intelligible</a>, an odd kind of poem, or an odd kind of technical manual.</blockquote><blockquote id="NrFRcIQlK">The reason for thinking that there will be no “last” philosophy is simply that no “answer” can fail to be an answer to a question, and that no question can guarantee its own permanent relevance. It is here that we find the core truth in all the clichés about “the illimitable reach of the mind,” “man’s striving for the infinite,” and so on.</blockquote><blockquote id="60ACWH2-a">The sense in which philosophy is “illimitable,” and the sense in which it is sui generis, may perhaps be clarified further by saying that whereas the arts may be expected to produce “visions,” and science and scholarship “results,” philosophy’s product can only be dialogue.</blockquote><blockquote id="CP9VBDOPC">As against science, in philosophy the criteria for being “evidence” for a position or for a claim being “well-founded” are themselves in question.</blockquote><blockquote id="JG_JD7CUe">Imaginative vision is, of course, just what distinguishes the first-rate scholar or scientist from the hack. Methodical care in exploring the possibilities of an idea or a technique is what distinguishes the artist from the dilettante. There is no discipline that does not require both “vision” and “method,” and whose practitioners are not praised for the presence and blamed for the absence of either.</blockquote><blockquote id="p_mQ04dtz">what is demanded of a philosopher is that he should be able to see what is presupposed by asking a certain question that other philosophers (or scientists, or people at large) have been in the habit of asking.</blockquote><blockquote id="IrQQT_cBL">When a philosopher tells us that pleasure is not a good, or that matter doesn’t exist, or that the law of noncontradiction is false, we may be willing to admit that he’s succeeded in questioning a presupposition that we’d never dreamed of questioning ourselves, but we still need to be shown that doing so is worth the trouble. It is this “naturalizing” of apparent paradoxes that is the work of the disciple in philosophy.</blockquote><blockquote id="pLTLy68tY">Idealism will become one more voice in a dialogue whose interlocutors are always growing in number, and in which the speeches are always growing more complex.</blockquote><blockquote id="e8B0eC7eT">Here is where “rigor” and the scientific ambience come in. To explain, for example, just why one cannot simultaneously adopt a Marxist view of ethics and a Humean view of perception is a long and arduous process.</blockquote><blockquote id="DOJTOmBli">the philosopher puts aside the role of questioner of questions and sets himself the task of working within a quite restricted framework of questions, assumptions, and criteria. He is no longer a spectator of all time and all eternity, but is simply asking “If we say X, can we then consistently say both Y and Z?” This is the kind of question where we can get both rigor in procedure and agreement on results.</blockquote><blockquote id="1kivT8LoH">Philosophers are philosophers not because they have common aims and interests (they don’t), or common methods (they don’t), or agree to discuss a common set of problems (they don’t), or are endowed with common faculties (they aren’t), but simply and solely because they are taking part in a single continuing conversation.</blockquote><blockquote id="opp46QajR">Once in a hundred times, therefore (the time when the question is posed within the dialogue rather than outside it), the question “Are philosophers doing what they should?” is not silly; on the contrary, it presages a new epoch of philosophical inquiry.</blockquote><blockquote id="XcjhD7iY-">One ceases to be an amateur in philosophy when, and only when, one stops asking philosophers to speak one’s own language and starts telling them in their language why they should cease to speak that language.</blockquote><blockquote id="u-7Z-bK9s">At the risk of a Leibnizian optimism, I want to say not only that professional philosophers are doing, by and large, about what they should be, but that they receive about the right amount of attention.</blockquote><blockquote id="KjjkbGA5L">To get things done, we all have to accept the burden of intellectual dishonesty involved in acting before the last questions have been resolved. Specifically, when action demands answers we must, insofar forth, neglect the possibility that we are asking the wrong questions. This means that we must often—even usually—systematically ignore the dialogue going on among philosophers as to the adequacy of questions.</blockquote><blockquote id="G-nl9v2Yw">There is a sense in which professional philosophy is as much of a parasite upon the ideological subculture as is the latter upon it. By watching the careers of, for example, Hegelian, Marxist, Thomist, or Deweyite slogans when they are caught up in ideological struggles and made into programs of action, the professional can re-evaluate what is living and what is dead in the body of philosophical speculation for which these slogans were originally abbreviations.</blockquote><blockquote id="QBsuJ1t5C">The professional philosophers are a group devoted to the continuance of the philosophical dialogue about the adequacy of questions, and possessing the detailed specialized knowledge of the history of this dialogue, and of its current career, which this continuance requires. They do a job that has to be done if the universal human dialogue about ends and means of action isn’t itself to cease. They don’t do more than this, and they don’t do less. Despite jibes about philosophy as a mere academic specialty and despite invidious comparisons with the philosophers of other ages and lands, American philosophers are doing this job as faithfully and well as it has ever been done.</blockquote><blockquote id="xpBER9tR9">dandyish dryness of tone.</blockquote><blockquote id="pa9Gus-kt">He took a good deal of pleasure in the phrase “evil empire”—which he applied to the Soviet Union in several articles published in liberal journals in the 1980s—</blockquote><blockquote id="ypK1Kh0WK">Now and then he was liable, I think, to generalize from his own good nature and thus to allow insufficiently for the operation of sadism in human affairs.</blockquote><blockquote id="vuILYmnIv">To see cruelty as what it is—the doing of deliberate harm to one’s fellow creatures—in Rorty’s view means to renounce the practice of cruelty.</blockquote><blockquote id="jAS8pp3dP">Conversation was his metaphor for a continuous cultural dialogue, in which the arts and sciences, knowledge and imagination, would be given free play, while the prestige or patina of the departments of learning would vanish.</blockquote><blockquote id="hLYQp51Vx">The idea of a conversation helps us to be tolerant and to give up the conceit of settling a quarrel once and for all and on our own</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
