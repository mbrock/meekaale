Brothels and the use of tobacco and alcohol, dubbed ‚Äòanti-aphrodisiacs‚Äô by Van Gogh, remained his only stimulants, sublimation by art his only solace.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="QFNUKy1aW">Vincent gave reports of his visits to Amsterdam museums and galleries,</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="7M42891Ku">Meanwhile, he advised his younger brother to smoke a pipe if he felt downcast, an idea he had taken from Dickens, who recommended tobacco as a remedy for suicide.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="GOUqtBdi3">How I wish I could have another talk with you about art, but we‚Äôll just have to keep writing to each other about it.

It goes deeper, I do assure you.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="o_yvjAeZZ">But, you will say, what a dreadful person you are, with your impossible religious notions and idiotic scruples.

If so, I think it would be much more economical to get paints, say, wholesale, for instance white, ochre, sienna, and we could then come to some arrangement about the money. Everything would be cheaper, it goes without saying.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="MD6YlOfXR">Mauve, who paints very frugally in comparison with J.

What impressed me so much at the time was something so stout and manly in Daumier‚Äôs conception, something that made me think it must be good to think and to feel like that and to overlook or ignore a multitude of things and to concentrate on what makes us sit up and think and what touches us as human beings more directly and personally than meadows or clouds.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="qJD9rGeSf">What is drawing? How does one come to it? It is working through an invisible iron wall that seems to stand between what one feels and what one can do. How is one to get through that wall ‚Äì since pounding at it is of no use? In my opinion one has to undermine that wall, filing through it steadily and patiently. And there you are ‚Äì how can one continue such work assidu2 without being distracted or diverted, unless one reflects and orders one‚Äôs life by principles? And as it is with art so it is with other things. And great things are not something accidental, they must be distinctly willed</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="ChTGYBt17">Whether a man‚Äôs deeds originate in his principles or his principles in his deeds is something that seems to me as indeterminable (and as little worthy of determination) as the question of which came first, the chicken or the egg. But I consider that trying to develop one‚Äôs power of thought and will is something positive and of much moment.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="U999g5nfV">On the other hand, Van Gogh nourished the conviction that the artist‚Äôs exceptional calling and position in society sometimes caused him to overstep the bounds of sanity.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="Q2nhvtNy8">‚ÄòI love my studio in the same way that a sailor loves his ship.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="SqdWW3RlT">We are surrounded by poetry on all sides, but putting it on paper is, alas, not as readily done as looking at it.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="BomkT8hYU">Still, the whole of nature is an indescribably beautiful Black & White exhibition2 during such snow effects.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="dl0GIf9dA">It may well seem to you that the sun is shining more brightly and that everything has taken on a new charm. That, at any rate, is the inevitable consequence of true love, I believe, and it is a wonderful thing. And I also believe that those who hold that no one thinks clearly when in love are wrong, for it is at just that time that one thinks very clearly indeed and is more energetic than one was before.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="jp3inJ4i_">And there is the same difference between someone who is in love and what he was like before as there is between a lamp that is lit and one that is not. The lamp was there all the time and it was a good lamp, but now it is giving light as well and that is its true function. And one has more peace of mind about many things and so is more likely to do better work.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="5wC_U-Lz-">I learned a lesson today thanks to that visit, namely that one is fortunate indeed if in present-day society one can live in fairly normal surroundings and has no need to resort to a coffee-house existence ‚Äì from which one starts to see things through a growing fog of confusion.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="gpBFhNReL">One sees many individuals who have something wrong with them ‚Äì I think it can‚Äôt be very healthy here, perhaps because of foul drinking water.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="Il3kOFtD7">How much sadness there is in life.

On the positive awareness that art is something greater and higher than our own skill or knowledge or learning. That art is something which, though produced by human hands, is not wrought by hands alone, but wells up from a deeper source, from man‚Äôs soul, while much of the proficiency and technical expertise associated with art reminds me of what would be called self-righteousness in religion.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="8xdMOWSlT">Let us try to grasp the secrets of technique so well that people will be taken in and swear by all that is holy that we have no technique.

You don‚Äôt know how paralysing that is, that stare of a blank canvas, which says to the painter: you can‚Äôt do a thing. The canvas has an idiotic stare and mesmerises some painters so much that they turn into idiots themselves. Many painters are afraid in front of the blank canvas, but the blank canvas is afraid of the real, passionate painter who dares and who has broken the spell of you can‚Äôt‚Äô once and for all. Life itself, too, is forever turning an infinitely vacant, disheartening, dispiriting blank side towards man on which nothing appears, any more than it does on a blank canvas. But no matter how vacant and vain, how dead life may appear to be, the man of faith, of energy, of warmth, who knows something, will not be put off so easily.</blockquote></div></section><section class="references"><h1 class="semibold mb-1">Incoming Links</h1><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/2021-03-26">March 26th, 2021</a></h3><div><p>By the way, "overflowing with fearless energy" reminds me of a passage I just love from <a class="ref" href="/books/the-letters-of-vincent-van-gogh">üìô The Letters of Vincent Van Gogh</a>, writing to his brother Theo:</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
