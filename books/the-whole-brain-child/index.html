When you think back about your first date or the birth of your child, you just open the appropriate file drawer in your brain and call up that memory.   It would be nice and convenient if this were true, but that’s just not the way the brain works. There aren’t thousands of little “memory files” in your head waiting for you to access them and bring them to consciousness so you can think about them. Instead, memory is all about associations.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
