The intense and meaningful lives of Homer‚Äôs Greeks, and the grand hierarchy of meaning that structured Dante‚Äôs medieval Christian world, both stand in stark contrast to our secular age.

The shining things now seem far away.</blockquote><blockquote id="etRHR4jfu">1 Our Contemporary Nihilism</blockquote><blockquote id="dt5WqFKli">If you look at the history of most people who are designated heroes in the military and in other places, most of the time they say the reaction they had was without any mental preparation.

Indeed, once we see the force of this contrast it becomes obvious why the central Homeric phenomena are hard to find in our modern world.

But the fact that there is a pantheon of gods, rather than a single one, indicates that there is no underlying principle that unifies their different ways of life.</blockquote><blockquote id="c8PAG8IqQ">This Homeric conception of the gods puts other demands on the well-lived life. For if the best kind of human life requires the presence of the gods, then the best kinds of human beings must invite the gods by expressing wonder and gratitude in their presence. To develop an appreciation, therefore, for those situations in life when favorable things occur out of our control, and to develop a sense of wonder and gratitude in the face of such situations‚Äîthis too is required for a life well-lived. When we develop in ourselves the ability for this kind of wonder and gratitude then we become a standing invitation to the gods.</blockquote><blockquote id="e7PHwkedZ">The central feature of Dante‚Äôs world is his sense that the universe is created by God, and therefore that its moral and spiritual meaning is written on its face.</blockquote><blockquote id="p0g-oHvo8">Far from there being no intrinsic meanings, the Medieval World is absolutely replete with them. We need to ask: Are there experiences at the margins of our own world that reflect the anti-nihilistic aspect of this medieval understanding?</blockquote><blockquote id="kUvpj0yeM">Dante thinks that you should intensify your <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a> and be committed to whatever attracts you with total devotion, and then if it fails to satisfy you, which it surely will, you can learn from your mistakes until you finally find someone or something worthy of total passion and commitment. The last thing you should do is trim your desire. Free will allows you to train your desires in the right direction.</blockquote><blockquote id="P32fCtz0l">According to St. Thomas the beatitude caused by the contemplation of God‚Äôs radiance is the ultimate goal of human life.

All the various meanings would cancel each other out. You would hear the chaos of white noise instead of the single, hidden truth of a rational universe.</blockquote><blockquote id="PQ76ugKC7">The multiple meanings of the universe simply don‚Äôt add up to a single, universal truth. Our only hope is to engage in each of them fully, live contentedly in the truths they reveal, but feel no urge to reconcile them to one another. The image for this kind of plural polytheism is neither the deafening chaos of white noise nor the dumb blankness of the color white. Rather, it is the rainbow that separates out the colors of the spectrum, and reveals each in its own wonderful hue.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div><h3 id="Jfr_rkiqL">Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-05">March 5th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote id="NjLgZoxoa">For Aeschylus, Zeus is no longer a personified god presiding over the pantheon.

As the pervasive background, he cannot be described, but he underlies all significant events. The chorus, for example, refers to ‚ÄúZeus: whatever he may be‚Äù14 and adds: ‚ÄúFor what thing without Zeus is done among mortals.‚Äù15</blockquote><blockquote id="Cz_WSIZAR">Zeus, in other words, is the hidden and unrepresentable background that sustains all the meaningful practices of the culture. This is such a deep and powerful conception of the sacred that it will figure centrally in the Judeo-Christian account of God the father, but it will not be evoked as the possible poetical achievement of Western culture until Melville‚Äôs Moby Dick.</blockquote><blockquote id="PKyhnmrRH">That is why the great Sperm Whale shall take the place of Zeus in the coming pantheon of gods.
