It is regarded as a view entertained from mere tendermindedness, as an emotional hangover from childhood indoctrination, or even as a manifestation of a desire to avoid disapproval and curry favor.</blockquote><blockquote id="l4E62ZjVJ">there is a difference between religion, a religion, and the religious;</blockquote><blockquote id="nSOhgjDil">However, in the Oxford Dictionary I find the following: ‚ÄúRecognition on the part of man of some unseen higher power as having control of his destiny and as being entitled to obedience, reverence and worship.‚Äù</blockquote><blockquote id="ZXdNDZtji">surcharged with implications</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="gZrzT2eFd">Beliefs and practices in a religion that now prevails are by this logic relative to the present state of culture. If so much flexibility has obtained in the past regarding an unseen power, the way it affects human destiny, and the attitudes we are to take toward it, why should it be assumed that change in conception and action has now come to an end?</blockquote><blockquote id="0EB1Uj8oD">It demands that in imagination we wipe the slate clean and start afresh by asking what would be the idea of the unseen, of the manner of its control over us and the ways in which reverence and obedience would be manifested, if whatever is basically religious in experience had the opportunity to express itself free from all historic encumbrances.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="9hHm_0i4D">we should believe that control of human destiny is exercised by a wise and loving spirit rather than by madcap ghosts or sheer force‚Äî</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="2coowKm7n">We have reached a point that invites us to proceed farther.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="OIFiSvqcg">‚ÄúReligion‚Äù is a strictly collective term and the collection it stands for is not even of the kind illustrated in textbooks of logic.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="B2QSR9mhy">Choice among religions is imperative, and the necessity for choice leaves nothing of any force in the argument from universality. Moreover, when once we enter upon the road of choice, there is at once presented a possibility not yet generally realized.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="I5YyIwX9Q">It is widely supposed that a person who does not accept any religion is thereby shown to be a non-religious person. Yet it is conceivable that the present depression in religion is closely connected with the fact that religions now prevent, because of their weight of historic encumbrances, the religious quality of experience from coming to consciousness and finding the expression that is appropriate to present conditions, intellectual and moral.</blockquote><blockquote id="UeVd1UhKb">I believe that such is the case. I believe that many persons are so repelled from what exists as a religion by its intellectual and moral implications, that they are not even aware of attitudes in themselves that if they came to fruition would be genuinely religious.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="UmLK9zm6e">I have several times used the phrase ‚Äúreligious elements of experience.‚Äù Now at present there is much talk, especially in liberal circles, of religious experience as vouching for the authenticity of certain beliefs and the desirability of certain practices, such as particular forms of prayer and worship. It is even asserted that religious experience is the ultimate basis of religion itself. The</blockquote><blockquote id="3JyIRU30w">Those who hold to the notion that there is a definite kind of experience which is itself religious, by that very fact make out of it something specific, as a kind of experience that is marked off from experience as √¶sthetic, scientific, moral, political; from experience as companionship and friendship. But ‚Äúreligious‚Äù as a quality of experience signifies something that may belong to all these experiences. It is the polar opposite of some type of experience that can exist by itself. The distinction comes out clearly when it is noted that the concept of this distinct kind of experience is used to validate a belief in some special kind of object and also to justify some special kind of practice.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="g7DH1D55H">these religionists are moved by the rise of the experimental method in other fields.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="lRIzUH6qA">the religionists rely upon a certain kind of experience to prove the existence of the object of religion, especially the supreme object, God.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="4y5HLoFw1">In reality, the only thing that can be said to be ‚Äúproved‚Äù is the existence of some complex of conditions that have operated to effect an adjustment in life, an orientation, that brings with it a sense of security and peace.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="pxb719932">Let us then for the moment drop the term ‚Äúreligious,‚Äù and ask what are the attitudes that lend deep and enduring support to the processes of living.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="SkVM4qCuh">The connection between imagination and the harmonizing of the self is closer than is usually thought.</blockquote><blockquote id="UyWoTo0sj">The whole self is an ideal, an imaginative projection. Hence the idea of a thoroughgoing and deep-seated harmonizing of the self with the Universe (as a name for the totality of conditions with which the self is connected) operates only through imagination‚Äîwhich is one reason why this composing of the self is not voluntary in the sense of an act of special volition or resolution.</blockquote><blockquote id="0U0zcXmnK">when conditions are adverse to realization of the objects of our desire‚Äîand in the case of significant ideals they are extremely adverse‚Äîit is an easy way out to assume that after all they are already embodied in the ultimate structure of what is, and that appearances to the contrary are merely appearances.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="QiU7mjLbx">The religious is ‚Äúmorality touched by emotion‚Äù only when the ends of moral conviction arouse emotions that are not only intense but are actuated and supported by ends so inclusive that they unify the self.</blockquote><blockquote id="CeCXYp1BI">All religions, marked by elevated ideal quality, have dwelt upon the power of religion to introduce perspective into the piecemeal and shifting episodes of existence. Here too we need to reverse the ordinary statement and say that whatever introduces genuine perspective is religious, not that religion is something that introduces it.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="kD3wgF0KD">Natural piety is not of necessity either a fatalistic acquiescence in natural happenings or a romantic idealization of the world. It may rest upon a just sense of nature as the whole of which we are parts, while it also recognizes that we are parts that are marked by intelligence and purpose, having the capacity to strive by their aid to bring conditions into greater consonance with what is humanly desirable. Such piety is an inherent constituent of a just perspective in life.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="qeZ7hpP89">Any activity pursued in behalf of an ideal end against obstacles and in spite of threats of personal loss because of conviction of its general and enduring value is religious in quality.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="PnVBsLsNo">If I have said anything about religions and religion that seems harsh, I have said those things because of a firm belief that the claim on the part of religions to possess a monopoly of ideals and of the supernatural means by which alone, it is alleged, they can be furthered, stands in the way of the realization of distinctively religious values inherent in natural experience.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="kpsSDsxeO">The skepticism and agnosticism that are rife and that from the standpoint of the religionist are fatal to the religious spirit are directly bound up with the intellectual contents, historical, cosmological, ethical, and theological, asserted to be indispensable in everything religious.</blockquote><blockquote id="vteyI-J21">The mind of man is being habituated to a new method and ideal: There is but one sure road of access to truth‚Äîthe road of patient, co√∂perative inquiry operating by means of observation, experiment, record and controlled reflection.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="GRlJUWNaJ">What is not realized‚Äîalthough perhaps it is more definitely seen by fundamentalists than by liberals‚Äîis that the issue does not concern this and that piecemeal item of belief, but centers in the question of the method by which any and every item of intellectual belief is to be arrived at and justified.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="VF40P7f-g">I should describe this faith as the unification of the self through allegiance to inclusive ideal ends, which imagination presents to us and to which the human will responds as worthy of controlling our desires and <a class="ref" href="/topics/choice">Choice</a>s.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="MVpUHTH3E">The method of intelligence is open and public. The doctrinal method is limited and private.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="-hOJJPYYQ">It is admitted that the objects of religion are ideal in contrast with our present state. What would be lost if it were also admitted that they have authoritative claim upon conduct just because they are ideal? The assumption that these objects of religion exist already in some realm of Being seems to add nothing to their force, while it weakens their claim over us as ideals, in so far as it bases that claim upon matters that are intellectually dubious.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="vE7i_yVZi">The import of the question extends far. It determines the meaning given to the word ‚ÄúGod.‚Äù On one score, the word can mean only a particular Being. On the other score, it denotes the unity of all ideal ends arousing us to desire and actions.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="BNONi-pcR">The idea that ‚ÄúGod‚Äù represents a unification of ideal values that is essentially imaginative in origin when the imagination supervenes in conduct is attended with verbal difficulties owing to our frequent use of the word ‚Äúimagination‚Äù to denote fantasy and doubtful reality.</blockquote><blockquote id="8J5qm2qkr">An ideal is not an illusion because imagination is the organ through which it is apprehended. For all possibilities reach us through the imagination.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="ylNeRSsB-">The reality of ideal ends and values in their authority over us is an undoubted fact. The validity of justice, affection, and that intellectual correspondence of our ideas with realities that we call truth, is so assured in its hold upon humanity that it is unnecessary for the religious attitude to encumber itself with the apparatus of dogma and doctrine.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="8rHsFa8Vh">Belief in the supernatural as a necessary power for apprehension of the ideal and for practical attachment to it has for its counterpart a pessimistic belief in the corruption and impotency of natural means.</blockquote><blockquote id="sY00U1yTw">The position of natural intelligence is that there exists a mixture of good and evil, and that reconstruction in the direction of the good which is indicated by ideal ends, must take place, if at all, through continued cooperative effort.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="BisHq4Bes">There is at least enough impulse toward justice, kindliness, and order so that if it were mobilized for action, not expecting abrupt and complete transformation to occur, the disorder, cruelty, and oppression that exist would be reduced.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="t4CbfWkuc">There are values, goods, actually realized upon a natural basis‚Äîthe goods of human association, of art and knowledge.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="45-47i3vO">We need no external criterion and guarantee for their goodness. They are had, they exist as good, and out of them we frame our ideal ends.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="Fh7H3fUVh">What I have been objecting to, I repeat, is not the idea that ideals are linked with existence and that they themselves exist, through human embodiment, as forces, but the idea that their authority and value depend upon some prior complete embodiment‚Äîas if the efforts of human beings in behalf of justice, or knowledge or beauty, depended for their effectiveness and validity upon assurance that there already existed in some supernal region a place where criminals are humanely treated, where there is no serfdom or slavery, where all facts and truths are already discovered and possessed, and all beauty is eternally displayed in actualized form.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="DWqVHrPcV">We are in the presence neither of ideals completely embodied in existence nor yet of ideals that are mere rootless ideals, fantasies, utopias. For there are forces in nature and society that generate and support the ideals. They are further unified by the action that gives them coherence and solidity. It is this active relation between ideal and actual to which I would give the name ‚ÄúGod.‚Äù</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="otZCi14v6">Imagination of ideal ends pertinent to actual conditions represents the fruition of a disciplined mind. There is, indeed, even danger that resort to mystical experiences will be an escape, and that its result will be the passive feeling that the union of actual and ideal is already accomplished.</blockquote><blockquote id="qLcHvr9TU">aggressive atheism seems to me to have something in common with traditional supernaturalism.</blockquote><blockquote id="qvhH4ZI_1">exclusive preoccupation of both militant atheism and supernaturalism with man in isolation.</blockquote><blockquote id="3Sqe9U9B1">Militant atheism is also affected by lack of natural piety.</blockquote><blockquote id="5qzpnS180">Use of the words ‚ÄúGod‚Äù or ‚Äúdivine‚Äù to convey the union of actual with ideal may protect man from a sense of isolation and from consequent despair or defiance.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="gFGkUQsJ9">The ‚Äúdivine‚Äù is thus a term of human choice and aspiration. A humanistic religion, if it excludes our relation to nature, is pale and thin, as it is presumptuous, when it takes humanity as an object of worship.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="yV9qzG8uB">Were the naturalistic foundations and bearings of religion grasped, the religious element in life would emerge from the throes of the crisis in religion. Religion would then be found to have its natural place in every aspect of human experience that is concerned with estimate of possibilities, with emotional stir by possibilities as yet unrealized, and with all action in behalf of their realization. All that is significant in human experience falls within this frame.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section></article></html>
