These transcendental humors frighten me.</blockquote><blockquote id="EOvAn5xL9">I have long held the personal essay to be one of the last bastions of the orthodoxy of the unitary <a class="ref" href="/topics/self">Self</a>: those of us who are drawn to practicing this form tend to believe in our possessing a core reality or self, and we would cling to this conviction even if critical theory disproved it beyond doubt.</blockquote><div class="indent"><p id="kKnpD2pfC"><strong>Tags</strong>: #<a class="ref" href="/topics/blue">blue</a></p></div><blockquote id="VHfJI4kGW">Poe may have said that a poem must be short or face the risk of mounting imperfection, but pace Poe, perfection is very rare in literature and probably overrated.</blockquote><div class="indent"><p id="sYtWCP-oQ"><strong>Tags</strong>: #<a class="ref" href="/topics/blue">blue</a></p></div><blockquote id="XyxXjk1ey">Ozick ends with the following question, ‚ÄòYour hair is whitening, you are a well of tears, what you meant to do (beauty and justice) you have not done, papa and mama are under the earth, you live in panic and dread, the future shrinks and darkens, stories are only vapor, your inmost craving is for nothing but an old scarred pen, and what, God knows, is that?</blockquote><div class="indent"><p id="SOWmxRNAv"><strong>Tags</strong>: #<a class="ref" href="/topics/blue">blue</a></p></div><blockquote id="ROJdXO7el">I have nothing to say about myself absolutely, simply, and solidly, without confusion and without mixture, or in one word.</blockquote><div class="indent"><p id="VlD5slkHi"><strong>Tags</strong>: #<a class="ref" href="/topics/pink">pink</a></p></div><blockquote id="g2-KVfGCv">Often, I am no sooner asked by an editor to write on a certain topic than I begin to experience a nauseated opposition to the assignment. It could be laziness, or a knee-jerk reaction against authority, or it could be reluctance to comply with what I sense is a conventional exercise. So, for instance, when I agreed to contribute to an anthology of essays by Jewish-American authors about their personal relationship to the Holocaust, I ended up writing a piece called ‚ÄúResistance to the Holocaust,‚Äù in which I interrogated my own aversion to this subject matter.</blockquote><blockquote id="oNikGPLqY">In testing the validity of certain pieties, the contrarian essay performs a valuable function, like the null hypothesis in experimental science.</blockquote><div class="indent"><p id="P7p0zbFBG"><strong>Tags</strong>: #<a class="ref" href="/topics/pink">pink</a></p></div><blockquote id="mAAFx3Xf0">(The funny thing is that by and large I am a nice guy, but I need the fiction that I‚Äôm not in order to sustain me in the act of writing.)</blockquote><div class="indent"><p id="jR9mF17qd"><strong>Tags</strong>: #<a class="ref" href="/topics/blue">blue</a></p></div><blockquote id="0owQaBu1N">To be a writer is a monstrously arrogant act.</blockquote><div class="indent"><p id="rEcOly9cs"><strong>Tags</strong>: #<a class="ref" href="/topics/favorite">favorite</a> #<a class="ref" href="/topics/blue">blue</a></p></div><blockquote id="pkinTLw3S">Have you ever seen two writers of medium reputation being introduced to each other for the first time? Each is probably thinking, ‚ÄúHow can he be a writer? I am the writer.‚Äù Each sees himself as the emperor of an unrecognized kingdom. It is like that case of the three mental patients in Ypsilanti State Hospital, each with the unshakable conviction that he was Jesus Christ, even after being put together with the other two who had the same delusion.</blockquote><blockquote id="dF4KZGMFA">Good writers down through the ages have known how to cut through the thickness of complexity when it suited them and simply declare. The turn toward aphorism frequently signals this intention.</blockquote><blockquote id="V1p9Irfe2">Sometimes a writer may even bring into existence, through assertion, more wisdom than he or she possessed before beginning to write the sentence. To put it another way: the words themselves, by having been placed in their most compact formulation, generate, side by side, magnetic reactions amongst themselves that release unforeseen meanings. Good writers are always trying to write above their heads, to hit on understandings beyond their conscious knowledge, through fortuitous word choice.</blockquote><blockquote id="z339DzRjB">The first time I was assigned to write a review for The New York Times Book Review, I found myself again in the situation of having to invent a persona: to pretend to be this cultivated, self-assured, supremely balanced arbiter who had only a glancing relationship to my everyday self.</blockquote><blockquote id="U7Y6yG5gv">It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôve made up a contrarian or curmudgeonly persona, but that my physiological restlessness, my low tolerance for boredom, my neurotic antipathy to sentimentality all dictate that I throw in a dash of paradox, humorous chagrin, or spite.</blockquote><div class="indent"><p id="r2fQoEnr-"><strong>Tags</strong>: #<a class="ref" href="/topics/blue">blue</a></p></div><blockquote id="TxECZk06n">Here the creative nonfiction writer can follow the journalists‚Äô lead.

When you are researching, what you are looking for, subconsciously or not, is the oddity that will spark your imagination‚Äînot necessarily the most important detail, but the one that will excite your love of paradox or sense of humor.</blockquote><blockquote id="naFsJrDEl">Because some thoughts cannot be expressed in the Strunk and White, keep-it-simple-and-clear recipe, they require a more sinuous, self-reflective, devious syntax.</blockquote><div class="indent"><p id="M1TIPbLdX"><strong>Tags</strong>: #<a class="ref" href="/topics/blue">blue</a></p></div><blockquote id="3aEpnlxLk">We go through life like an electromagnetic needle nervously agitating between the undesirable poles of alpha-flat zombie and tortured suffering, trying to find the right voltage of bracingly vivifying pleasure/pain in the middle.</blockquote><blockquote id="YKCRm7_qA">We tend to value renegades like Thoreau, doomed alcoholics like Poe, recluses like Dickinson, misunderstood visionaries like Melville, expansive gay bards like Whitman.</blockquote><div class="indent"><p id="Qlfiswo9T"><strong>Tags</strong>: #<a class="ref" href="/topics/blue">blue</a></p></div><blockquote id="MIh0-bxQL">At the same time he felt the failure of most attempts at empathy: ‚ÄúMan is insular, and cannot be touched.
