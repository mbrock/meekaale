When asked whom they confided in when as children they were lonely or in psychic pain, almost none recall feeling invited or safe enough to bare their souls to their parents.</blockquote><blockquote id="lpdLWEPm_">When I explore with my clients their childhood histories, emerging most often are patterns of relationships that required the child to take care of the parent emotionally, if only by keeping her inmost feelings to herself so as not to burden the parent.</blockquote><blockquote id="tZksVjAY_">At our second session, I asked Andrea, the fifty-year-old self-confessed failure at the game of existence justification, if she had truly never done anything worthwhile in her life. She was silent for a while. “I have tried to be kind to people,” she finally replied. “I have tried not to hurt people. I am creative in crafts. I teach people. I do a bit of gardening. But to me those things come easily. That’s just who I am. I didn’t have to work at them much. I mean, I’m not an accountant or a lawyer.” “Would you want to be an accountant or a lawyer?” “It’s not that I feel like doing those things,” Andrea said, again after a moment’s pause. “It’s that I think I should feel like doing them. I am still trying to get my father’s approval.”</blockquote><blockquote id="pGjdAdh-r">In my undergraduate years and even beyond, I had little respect for my ability to write. I could use it to advantage—for example, my capacity for relatively elegant verbal flourishes inflated the value of some pretty thin essays—but I had little regard for it precisely because I felt it came naturally to me. “I don’t trust my words,” I would say. “They come too easily.” It never occurred to me that possessing a vein of talent did not mean that one could not work diligently at mining it.</blockquote><blockquote id="Ydt1kuqSg">The adult with ADD is buried under a mound of yeses, many of which are not true yeses at all, only no’s he dared not say. Life is one long exercise in trying to tunnel out from under them, a frustrating task since one keeps adding to the stack faster than one can take away from it.</blockquote><blockquote id="WN89Cps-m">If the child does not feel accepted unconditionally, he learns to work for acceptance and attention. When he is not doing this work, he feels anxious, owing to an unconscious fear of being cut off from the parent. Later—as an adult—when not doing something specific, he has a vague unease, the feeling that he should somehow be working.</blockquote><blockquote id="7pYy5K5gx">The adult has no psychological rest because the infant and child had never known psychological rest.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="cS9aUcTgo">Submerged beneath a surface rippling with superficial and childish impulses are truer impulses for meaningful activity, the assertion of her autonomy, the pursuit of her own truth and human connectedness. The deeper these have sunk, the less one knows who she is or in which direction her path lies. Attaining self-esteem begins with finding our true impulses and raising them to the light of day.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="lsimDVyfN">The reflexive shrinking away from intimacy undermines the ability of the ADD adult to find what he would find most healing: mutually committed loving contact with another human being.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="TawRDdGJx">Trevor has tried therapy here and there in the past. These efforts usually ended after a few sessions spent trying to identify the traumatic events that would have led to his confused and conflicting emotions around relationships. The problem was that he could not recall anything traumatic.</blockquote><blockquote id="T2ORkDFPt">There are memories, the psychiatrist Mark Epstein explains, “that are not so much about something terrible happening, but, in the words of D. W. Winnicott [the great British children’s psychoanalyst] about ‘nothing happening when something might profitably have happened.’ These events are more often recorded in the soma, or body, than in the verbal memory, and they can be integrated only by subsequently experiencing and making sense of them.”</blockquote><blockquote id="-R63BtT5u">People with ADD are exquisitely sensitive to the merest hint of it, even if the hint is only a figment of their fearful imagination. It is triggered by any stimulus that ever so vaguely resembles rejection, even if no rejection is intended.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="gsMbW6lTl">Especially men with ADD will, entering deeper into a relationship, keep half an eye on possible exits.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="LgiVn5vjl">Many adults with ADD report that they quickly become bored with relationships, as with much else in life. They imagine this boredom of theirs to mean that something is lacking in their partner: the reality is that they are bored with themselves.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="qB01xWGuo">“It’s only when I am alone that I can really be myself,” said Frank, a fifty-year-old writer who came to see me in the immediate after-math of yet another abortive relationship.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="Ox5BCB41Q">The unsolved problem is how to be oneself in contact with other people.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="26l0GXGBG">One gauge of persistent problems with intimacy in an ADD relationship is the couple’s sexual life—or the lack of it. “Non-existent” and “What sex life?” are two of the common replies my questioning around this subject tends to bring. The lack of sexual intimacy is in most cases an unmistakable sign of mutual emotional shutdown.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="XwdKcW2m0">Also dampening sexual ardor is the propensity of the ADD adult, the male especially, to behave like an irresponsible child. This may lead his spouse to act like his mother—organizing his life, taking care of his emotional needs.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="Jv0IWh13_">The couple find themselves chronically caught in the dense shrubbery of anxiety, control, resistance and oppositionality. One of the problems with such a mother/son relationship is, of course, that no mother in her right mind wants to sleep with her son; nor do reasonably healthy men fancy going to bed with their mothers.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="2Wfnm1DvR">I have frequently advised couples that if they truly want adult intimacy, they mutually need to give up the parent/child roles toward each other.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="Le45R2RP3">What we might call the law of equal development holds true even if the partners themselves buy into the mythology that one of them is more emotionally mature than the other.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="p4PeLdpOz">Since ADD by definition implies underdeveloped emotional intelligence, any such relationship, also by definition, will begin with two people who have both been stuck at fairly early stages of emotional development.</blockquote><blockquote id="CeA0aVTTc">By maturity, I mean here the degree of individuation, the capacity of the person to genuinely sustain herself emotionally during difficult times without having to be mothered or fathered by someone else.</blockquote><blockquote id="NMYryvHuT">Guilt is obsessively single-minded, knowing only one stimulus and only one response. The stimulus is this: you, child or adult, wish to do something for yourself that may disappoint someone else. This could be a true misdeed, such as stealing, or a human desire to act in accordance with your core impulses, perhaps by expressing a genuine feeling the parent cannot tolerate in you. Guilt does not know the difference. It hurls at you the same epithet for both misdeed and self-expression: selfish.</blockquote><blockquote id="wme91KmJn">It may seem contradictory to acknowledge that in fact many people with ADD do act in selfish ways, particularly when it comes to their <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>s and compulsions of various sorts. How does that square with what has been said just now about the inhibiting effect of guilt and anxiety? I can attest that in some important aspects of my life—not all—I have always been a people pleaser, suppressing my truest self. I have also often behaved with narcissistic self-regard. The more the core self—the deepest impulses—is suppressed, the more compulsive are the attempts to compensate by satisfying superficial, infantile, instant-gratification impulses and desires.</blockquote><blockquote id="pVUCWg-4c">Of all types of professional training, the one I consider most likely to be of benefit in ADD is <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a> therapy. The skilled <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a> therapist is not fixated on people’s dysfunctions and their difficult feelings. She helps clients acknowledge painful emotions but also helps them to see their problems in the context of the multigenerational <a class="ref" href="/topics/family">Family</a> system that they are part of.</blockquote><blockquote id="40Pa8_TiW">THE ADULT WITH attention deficit disorder who hopes to do more than control her symptoms with medication has to learn to take care of herself, as a parent would take care of a child.</blockquote><blockquote id="NkiLZ_lMu">First, make a conscious choice about how to live. A man may look at the disaster zone in his room and decide consciously to do nothing about it. There is no should here, nor should there be a should.</blockquote><blockquote id="C-IHUyP0V">It is not a duty to clear some physical space so that his mind is not oppressed by the clutter, but it is a sensible thing to do if the long-term goal is development.</blockquote><blockquote id="8cIxhrn-U">The adult with attention deficit disorder needs to know that the physical space she occupies can help to either harmonize or disorganize her <a class="ref" href="/topics/mind">Mind</a>.</blockquote><blockquote id="h9quH3jgc">The best plan, I find, is not to insist that any one task be finished but to impose a strict time limit in which to work. When the appointed time period is over, stop. This will eventually lead to a better appreciation of what one actually does with time when carrying out strange and unnatural <a class="ref" href="/topics/ritual">Ritual</a>s like picking clothes off the floor or sorting out dusty magazines in a corner.</blockquote><blockquote id="cNhbnsPyu">A contributing factor is that the distractible ADD mind does find it easier to focus when the noises and intrusions of the day have abated, and everyone else has gone to bed. Many adults have told me this is when they get their best work done, or when they feel at <a class="ref" href="/topics/peace">Peace</a> enough to read or to rest.</blockquote><blockquote id="G7AL312Ku">There is matchless unity, harmony and <a class="ref" href="/topics/peace">Peace</a> in <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a>—all that is lacking, in other words, in the ADD mind. Many parents will note that the hyperkinetic brain or body or mouth of their son or daughter will gradually slow down after a few short days away from the hurly-burly of everyday urban life.</blockquote><blockquote id="QL6lYhLed">I do not believe ADD leads to creativity any more than creativity causes ADD. Rather, they both originate in the same inborn trait: sensitivity.</blockquote><blockquote id="qjLp3gcTx">With all these self-parenting tasks, the catch-22 for the ADD adult is that the very state he is wanting to grow out of hinders his capacity to create the conditions required for growth. In order to settle the chaos <a class="ref" href="/topics/inside">Inside</a>, we have to clear up the chaos outside, which was generated in the first place by the chaos <a class="ref" href="/topics/inside">Inside</a>.</blockquote><blockquote id="dRIr4uR6r">My confusion—and I see this in the ADD addict repeatedly—was that both behavior dependencies represented genuine parts of me, though exaggerated. The <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> to music or books could masquerade in my own eyes as an aesthetic passion, and my <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a> to work as a service to humanity—and I do have aesthetic passion, and I do wish to serve humanity.</blockquote><blockquote id="At16OPMM5">Only people who have not witnessed or personally experienced how helpful medications can be could maintain a categorical opposition to their use. The positive effects are often dramatic and immediate. One patient of mine, a fifty-four-year-old woman, came back excitedly after taking a low dose of the psychostimulant Dexedrine. “I never saw the trees,” she said. “We live across a park and have a beautiful view, but I never noticed before how green it was.”</blockquote><blockquote id="TbFVR9Gl1">A teenager for whom I recently prescribed Ritalin, a fifteen-year-old with a cunning sense of humor, approached her parents a half hour after taking her first dose. “I feel like listening to a boring lecture from a geography teacher,” she said. What she did, in fact, was watch the educational channel, a first. That evening she also had the first calm and intimate talk with her mother in years.</blockquote><blockquote id="nxKlHA-Wf">There is no reason to be afraid of them, however. More exactly, if we are to be reluctant to use them, it should be for the right reasons, not because of misinformation, such as that these drugs are addictive if used for ADD.</blockquote><blockquote id="io82-XKxQ">While they are subject to abuse, as are other legitimate medications, their administration in medically prescribed doses does not induce addiction. A better case can be made that they may prevent addictions, by correcting some of the biochemistry that predisposes a person to substance abuse, as described in the previous chapter.</blockquote><blockquote id="H3cTWl4Sg">Drugs, of course, do not alter the major issues a person needs to struggle with. In some cases they can be of tremendous help, and in others their benefits are more limited. In no case do they resolve the basic problems of low self-esteem, fear of intimacy, driven lifestyles and lack of self-knowledge. The medications, if taken, should be used with the specific purpose of reducing distractibility and improving concentration and focusing, not of changing people’s lives.</blockquote><blockquote id="KRVyW9cau">Not infrequently, the ADD adult may be suffering from chronic low-grade depression or anxiety. If this is the case, the psychostimulants may not help, or in some cases may make matters worse. If depression or anxiety is present, it needs to be addressed first, or at least at the same time.</blockquote><blockquote id="8BGvqc2eC">The most serious problem with the widespread use of medications in the treatment of attention deficit disorder is that very often—probably in the vast majority of cases—they are the only form of intervention consistently pursued. Yet in themselves they do not promote long-term positive changes.</blockquote><blockquote id="HVXFYWfkd">Attention deficit disorder is not primarily a medical problem. Neither its causes nor its manifestations are due to illness.</blockquote><blockquote id="hurB_JNxK">People have, with the help of so many conventions, resolved everything the easy way, on the easiest side of the easy. But it is clear we must embrace struggle. Every living thing conforms to it. Everything in <a class="ref" href="/topics/nature">Nature</a> grows and establishes itself in its own way, establishing its own identity, insisting on it at all cost, against all resistance. We can be sure of very little, but the need to court struggle is a surety that will not leave us. – RAINER MARIA RILKE, Letters to a Young Poet</blockquote><blockquote id="x1XPmWvAB">“I HAVE SPENT my whole life pretending to be normal,” said fifty-year-old Elizabeth, an interior designer. The pretense of normality is familiar to any adult with attention deficit disorder. She works at fitting in by toning down the strength of her feelings about matters that others seem to think unimportant, by struggling to suppress her intensity and by feigning an interest in what bores her to tears. The game is precarious. No matter how clever the alien becomes at attempting to pass as an earthling, some telling awkwardness in his manner, some fatal expression of his true nature will, in unguarded moments, betray him for what he is: different.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="vuWyxzjgo">The world is much more ready to accept someone who is different and comfortable with it than someone desperately seeking to conform by denying himself.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="Ykqr3xEWi">I have learned through my own process that a goal in life cannot be the avoidance of painful feelings. For people like me with ADD, and for everyone else, emotional pain is a reality. It does not have to exclude joy and a capacity to experience the beauty of life.</blockquote><blockquote id="j9R5FiPsu">Throughout this book, I have insisted on the connection between human relationship and attention. <a class="ref" href="/topics/love">Love</a>, it turns out, is intimately related to attention.</blockquote><blockquote id="MFEDyrVTM">Adults with ADD face the most difficult task of all: learning how to be loving toward themselves. This is the greatest struggle because it requires that we gradually shed the defenses we have come to identify as the self and venture into new territory.</blockquote></div><h3 id="bsx8mpEW3">Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-01-14">January 14th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote id="fxCzZKie-">My path to diagnosis was similar to that of many other adults with ADD. I found out about the condition almost inadvertently, researched it and sought professional confirmation that my intuitions about myself were reliable. So few doctors or psychologists are familiar with attention deficit disorder that people are forced to become self-cultivated experts by the time they find someone who can make a competent assessment.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="lQyKeh4I4">With an impatience and lack of judgment characteristic of ADD, I had already begun to self-medicate, even before the formal diagnosis. A sense of urgency typifies attention deficit disorder, a desperation to have immediately whatever it is that one may desire at the moment, be it an object, an activity or a relationship.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="_EPrc_lAg">I took Ritalin in a higher than recommended initial dose on the very day I first heard about attention deficit disorder. Within minutes, I felt euphoric and present, experienced myself as full of insight and love. My wife thought I was acting weird.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="wJE7RO9mJ">I was not an undereducated teenager eager for kicks when I self-administered the Ritalin. Already in my fifties, I was a successful and respected family doctor whose columns of medical opinion were praised for their thoughtfulness. I practice medicine with a high value on avoiding pharmacology unless absolutely necessary, and needless to say, I have always advised patients against self-medicating. Such striking imbalance between intellectual awareness on the one hand and emotional and behavioral self-control on the other is characteristic of people with attention deficit disorder.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="pNxBKDclK">The hallmark of ADD is an automatic, unwilled “tuning-out,” a frustrating nonpresence of <a class="ref" href="/topics/mind">Mind</a>.</blockquote><blockquote id="gTzTvNAFu">“I feel like I am a human giraffe” is how one man described it, “as if my head is floating in a different world, way above my body.”</blockquote><blockquote id="Ph9ou78T8">Completely lacking in the ADD <a class="ref" href="/topics/mind">Mind</a> is a template for order, a mental model of how order comes about.</blockquote><blockquote id="dXUJMBGRd">Like many others with ADD, I have little ability to conceptualize in three dimensions or to divine the spatial relationships of things, no matter how well they are explained.</blockquote><blockquote id="r_kpuRQjA">A facility for focusing when one is interested in something does not rule out ADD, but to be able to focus, the person with ADD needs a much higher level of motivation than do other people.</blockquote><blockquote id="UT1P-FwdH">What can be immobilizingly difficult is to arouse the brain’s motivational apparatus in the absence of personal interest.</blockquote><blockquote id="rtlgVtsop">Some adults with ADD have told me that they speak so quickly partly because so many words and phrases tumble into their minds that they fear forgetting the most important ones unless they release them at a fast rate.</blockquote><blockquote id="XIes9WJOY">The individual with ADD experiences the <a class="ref" href="/topics/mind">Mind</a> as a perpetual-motion <a class="ref" href="/topics/machine">Machine</a>.

If anyone who exhibits any trait of it were to be diagnosed with ADD, we might as well put Ritalin in the drinking water and sign up most of the industrialized world for group psychotherapy. As Drs. Hallowell and Ratey point out in Driven to Distraction, ADD is a diagnosis not of category but of dimension. At a certain point on the human continuum, the characteristics associated with ADD become intrusive enough to impair a person’s functioning to one degree or another.</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote id="oVn1G1UWw">There was never any question of a lack of love in our home.

On Saturday mornings, there would be a crash. I was enveloped in a kind of enervated lethargy, hiding behind a book or a newspaper or staring morosely out the window. I was not only fatigued from the whirlwind week, but I did not know what to do with myself. Without the weekday adrenaline rush, I felt a lack of focus, purpose, energy.

We would be wrong to see these hardy little survivors as having some sort of plant disease; they have developed to the maximum that the relatively harsh conditions of climate and soil allow. If we wish to understand why they differ so dramatically from their inland relatives, we need to know under what conditions majestically tall, stout and ramrod-straight fir trees are able to thrive. It is the same with human beings. We do not have to look for diseases to explain why some people are not able to experience the full flowering of their potential.

Family strife and parental depression contribute to the child’s ADD problems not just because of their negative influence on attunement during brain development. Stressed or depressed mothers are found to be more short-tempered, more controlling and more angry with their children. Depression, particularly in the mother, also evokes an aggressive response from many a young child, quite probably due to the child’s rage at what she unconsciously interprets as the emotional withdrawal of the mother. One mother of an ADD child told me that when she had been depressed, her daughter, then a toddler, became inexplicably aggressive toward playmates or</blockquote></div><h3 id="EqnBV_UGc">Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-20">March 20th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote id="TBSbUEH6k">Parents of ADD children, in other words, seem to be relatively alienated from their own families of origin.</blockquote></div><h3 id="jGgcOpYmu">Highlights from <a class="ref" href="/days/2021-03-25">March 25th, 2021</a>.</h3><div class="indent"><blockquote id="MIj8Hv0_7">Parental love is such a wise and powerful force of nature that when parents extend themselves in an effort to understand who their children are and why they do what they do, the right words and actions will follow almost of their own volition.</blockquote><blockquote id="WYnl1_oVj">We can let go of what we understand; we cling most ferociously to aspects of ourselves that remain hidden to us and whose power we do not comprehend. A person learns to become aware of the tone in which he addresses his inquiries to himself: am I conducting an inquisition against myself or a helpful, insight-oriented interview?</blockquote><blockquote id="BsNFy8yex">Self-acceptance is not a pie-in-the sky abstract concept, because there is no abstract self floating around, begging to be accepted. The self is as we experience ourselves: happy one moment, anxious the next; confident in the morning, guilty and ashamed in the afternoon; giving now, needy then.</blockquote><blockquote id="TFKbl7frM">Guilt is a prime example of an emotion ADD adults would crawl through jungles to escape. It is sometimes difficult for people to understand that their psychological safety does not lie in avoiding the feeling of guilt at all costs but in learning to live with it.</blockquote><blockquote id="Qs3EKTFAX">“I’m a people pleaser” is the routine self-description of ADD adults. “I’m always so conscious of what the other person might need from me. I feel guilty if I disappoint someone. I can never say no.” Or, “I am the kind of person whom everyone calls to tell their troubles to. I can’t do that myself, though. I would feel guilty, thinking of all the people in the world who have suffered much more than I can even imagine. I shouldn’t need help.”</blockquote><blockquote id="y56fjin39">Better if people learned to accept the guilt but to judge its message for themselves. It can’t help being there. It speaks the voice of intricately wired implicit memory circuits. A person cannot forcibly get rid of it, and can only temporarily buy its silence by obeying. She might as well welcome it as a sign of growing self-nurturance. At least in the beginning of growth, if she does not feel guilt, she is probably ignoring her truest self.</blockquote><blockquote id="Apq93RkB5">A loving mother and father can make themselves available to spend time with their child, to hear her story, to help her express her feelings, to mirror her emotions, but the adult needs to find a parent substitute. The people trained to do such work are counselors and psychotherapists.</blockquote><blockquote id="41SbcGRBh">The purpose of psychotherapy and counseling is not that the therapist either heals the “patient” or advises him what to do with his life. The goal is to mature and to individuate, to become a self-respecting person in his own right. In other words, the goal is not to be “cured” but to develop.</blockquote><blockquote id="hzZSedPdD">In the medical model, the patient presents the doctor with the symptoms; having elicited the necessary information, the doctor makes the diagnosis and prescribes, administers or performs the cure. This approach works for a broken bone but not for a wounded psyche, for an inflamed appendix but not for inflamed emotions.</blockquote><blockquote id="IZNZi-_4d">Family therapy refers to the approach of the therapist, the training he had. A single adult can see a family therapist by himself; in the case of couples, both would attend.</blockquote><blockquote id="-9Ux0QksA">People with ADD tend to have trouble recognizing, let alone respecting, their gut feelings.</blockquote><blockquote id="eoQTSE6HK">I have often seen clients who had stayed on with a particular psychiatrist, psychologist or other therapist for months or years, long after they became aware of feeling that they were not being helped, or even that they were having a negative experience. Their fear of those old servants guilt and anxiety kept them there. Better to have stayed with the guilt and the anxiety and left the therapist.</blockquote><blockquote id="hOjDQxX9B">Caught up by the swirling currents of her brain, she has coasted on automatic pilot all her life, engaged in the details of daily existence, giving little thought to what her needs would be for a saner, more self-connected existence. Time is scattered like sunlight through a sieve.</blockquote><blockquote id="HjbjtWM_w">A good parent does more than get her child through the day. She is mindful that the child is a life-in-development, with needs dictated by the future as much as by the present. Adults with ADD cannot remember themselves in the future, as John Ratey has said.</blockquote><blockquote id="edgJGuhz_">When I ask adults to rate themselves according to a simple scale gauging the parenting skills and attention they devote to themselves, the scores tend to be low—so scandalously low that I have advised many of my clients that if they truly were the unfortunate child being parented by them, I would have had little choice but to alert the child protection authorities.</blockquote><blockquote id="thvQF7MnR">A person cannot become sane in the midst of the chaos she perpetuates around herself.</blockquote><blockquote id="D1Rk6H_ZA">Counterwill, the automatic resistance to pressure, will arise in response to dictates from himself as readily as to the commands of others. He needs to allow himself at least the same degree of autonomy he would grant to a teenager.</blockquote><blockquote id="TcMF2BhWy">The ADD brain is overwhelmed by a multipartite task. She does not know where to turn, and the all-or-nothing mind-set demands that everything be done at once.</blockquote><blockquote id="i77TTMgWW">Maintaining physical order may not be a difficult chore for other people, but the ADD adult might as well accept from the beginning that he will keep failing at it for some time to come. That does not matter. The effort itself, in the long term, has an organizing effect on the mind.</blockquote><blockquote id="phQjvbC2f">The parent wishes to provide the child with nutritious and attractive meals, served in an atmosphere free of tension and meant to be consumed in a leisurely fashion. Challenged on this point of self-parenting, most ADD adults throw up their hands in exasperation.</blockquote><blockquote id="gukg2BNl8">Lack of exercise leads to an internal sluggishness that undermines alertness and attention. Exercise releases substances in the brain that are necessary for mood stability, motivation and attention and, in the long term, makes the chemical apparatus that manufactures these substances more efficient. I recommend that people set a goal of vigorous exercise every day.</blockquote><blockquote id="-UMEOsKeJ">People with ADD, habituated lifelong to self-generated tension, tend to have tight muscles and stiff joints and ligaments. Simple stretching exercises done for a few minutes daily are tremendously freeing physically and psychologically.</blockquote><blockquote id="CzhGIU_8v">The ADD adult’s workaholism and dread of the word “no” leads her to overextend herself. A large proportion of the ADD clients I have seen are juggling too many projects, commitments that leave them with nary a moment to finish a thought. We engulf ourselves in hubbub, chase our minds in ten directions at once and then wonder why we cannot stand still long enough to notice anything.</blockquote><blockquote id="nqUG3wKXH">On Internet chat lines about attention deficit disorder, one can find lists of success stories: individuals who, despite their ADD, became great artists, writers, geniuses. It is even argued—dubiously, in my opinion—that ADD confers advantages such as creativity and a good sense of humor. Mozart, Einstein and Edison are some of the illustrious examples.</blockquote><blockquote id="jtYvMPtyE">I would myself love to believe that the neurophysiological impairments and psychological dysfunctions I have been writing about in this book also have their positive side, granting me, like others, some powers of creative expression. Unfortunately, though, what gifts I may have been blessed with have not been helped in their development by my disorganization, drivenness, distractibility, lack of persistence, forgetfulness and periods of psychic lethargy.</blockquote><blockquote id="XPc3UjkyZ">Colin came to see me recently. He has begun to work in Vancouver’s thriving film industry. He is loving it and will soon take a courageous plunge into economic insecurity by quitting his hotel job. “There is only one thing I feel bad about,” he says. “I am working with all these people who knew what they wanted. They are twenty years ahead of me. I have a lot of catching up to do.”</blockquote><blockquote id="pqzX2JpRi">The ADD mind is most uncomfortable with meditation, is intensely bored with it. It’s all the more amazing to me that recently I have actually come to enjoy and look forward to it. It becomes fun, after a while, to watch the fretful and anxious mind do its backwards flips, somersaults, and disappearing tricks—to observe it all, and work at not being identified with it, not mistaking it for me.</blockquote><blockquote id="_ToHxqrC1">Adults with ADD should at least consider giving themselves some daily opportunity for contemplative solitude.</blockquote><blockquote id="hxwViiK7d">Nothing is more difficult for the ADD mind than to meditate, or to contemplate anything with determined attention. A brain used to decades of inattention and disorganization will not overnight reorganize itself.</blockquote><blockquote id="RoYjom547">All <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>s are anesthetics. They separate us from the distress in our consciousness. We throw off our familiar and tired consciousness to assume another mind state we find more comfortable, at least temporarily. Desperate to be out of our mind and unaware, we surrender to the <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>, to be lulled into a walking sleep.</blockquote><blockquote id="fnssc-K_r">There have been times when my workaholism did not satisfy my need for oblivion. I needed more and found it in pursuits that vicariously fed my creative and spiritual needs—vicariously, because the driven ADD personality has no idea what his true needs are and must find for them some displaced, symbolic expression.</blockquote><blockquote id="BLjtLgbSk">My route was the compulsive buying of classical records and compact disks, alternating with—or conjointly with—the frenzied purchase of books. On the surface these may seem like innocent and even admirable pastimes—as they would be if undertaken consciously and in moderation. The addict has no such control. The compulsion beckons; the addict runs to serve it. Gradually, in each orgy of buying, I felt myself shrinking into a ghost of myself, full of self-contempt and apologetic for my existence.</blockquote><blockquote id="GxiqYqaWg">The effects on my family life were devastating, not because of financial privation or even primarily because of the time I spent away from home while haunting the stores. The major effect was that I could not be present—in both senses of being at home or attentive to my family—whenever I was in the grip of the fever.</blockquote><blockquote id="6T-b5wTOV">Inwardly, I could think of nothing but the music. Naturally, I hated myself, and the more I did, the harsher, more controlling and more critical I became with my sons and my daughter. We cannot endure seeing the needs of other people, least of all those of our children, when we are preoccupied with serving our own false needs.</blockquote><blockquote id="i9oeDyzIu">The <a class="ref" href="/topics/addiction">Addiction</a>, in a strange way, makes the addict feel more connected to life. The downside is that it separates him further and further from himself. He is feeding only his appetite, not his hunger.</blockquote></div></section><section class="references"><h1 class="semibold mb-1">Incoming Links</h1><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/2021-02-22">February 22nd, 2021</a></h3><div><p><a class="ref" href="/books/scattered-minds">📙 Scattered Minds</a> by <a class="ref" href="/topics/gabor-mate">Gabor Maté</a>; </p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/topics/idea">Idea</a></h3><div><p>From Gabor Maté's <a class="ref" href="/books/scattered-minds">📙 Scattered Minds</a>:</p></div></div></li><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/2021-03-02">March 2nd, 2021</a></h3><div><p>Such a conflict is implied in this description from <a class="ref" href="/topics/gabor-mate">Gabor Maté</a>'s book <a class="ref" href="/books/scattered-minds">📙 Scattered Minds</a>:</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
