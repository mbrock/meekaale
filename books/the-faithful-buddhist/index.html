My contention here is that this is only a problem if we have a mistaken idea of what constitutes agency.</blockquote><blockquote id="4SHfGLvAk">The concept of anatman would require us to understand that the “self” is completely an effect of social structures.</blockquote><blockquote id="hZ7THYMeH">We are produced as conscious beings in our social practices, and we cannot change who we are, and cannot be fully liberated, until we become able to choose and change our social practices.</blockquote><blockquote id="Z8Xw9EPfK">Our choices, our plans, and the structures of our social formations, all of these together make up our ideologies, and give rise to subject positions.</blockquote><blockquote id="yA6603aJA">Now, it is easy enough to become aware that our choices and our plans are not part of the mind-independent reality, that they are constructed by our social formations, that we choose what we are taught to choose and plan in the ways we have learned.  And then we think we are liberated, because we are aware of the social-constructedness of our desires and forms of thought, of our cravings and our language and our construal of the world.</blockquote><blockquote id="bK5MpaxaC">But at this point, we are still not liberated, because we are still reproducing the social formations which give rise to those desires and those forms of thought.</blockquote><blockquote id="TbldYFdkp">So long as we continue to act within these social formations, we can at best have a negative freedom, resisting the desires we still have, questioning the forms of our own thought; we continue to produce stagnation and deterioration and dissatisfaction, because we do not yet see that our desires and thoughts are thoroughly and radically immanent, the production of the very structures in which we live and move.</blockquote><blockquote id="AjAH9LlZO">To be liberated, we must produce new social formations, new collective practices in which we can participate, because the individual is nothing but an effect of such structures.  This must be a collective action, an attempt to increase the collective capacity to interact with mind-independent reality; no individual can be free in an unfree social system, except in a kind of negative freedom.</blockquote><blockquote id="jOhzcN561">Metzinger’s model very powerfully insists on an atomistic subject correctly perceiving the world, with possible errors or limits in our evolutionary biology.  He cannot consider the role of the social formations in producing the subject at all.</blockquote><blockquote id="kSMI99wy4">If language were socially produced, it could be a result of social formations and a site of social struggle, and this would require us to look for the mind and the subject in social formations instead of in the brain the computer metaphors of cognitive science.</blockquote><blockquote id="UEeelAykF">How might Metzinger’s theory function as an ideology?  It clearly requires both ignorance and error, so it is likely an ideology we would not willingly accept and participate in if we were made aware of it.  Let’s</blockquote><blockquote id="T5ekBMC2Y">Reproducing Romantic ideology, Metzigner separates out emotion and thought, assigning the former “natural” and causal status and suggesting that the latter has no real causal power and can be changed at will (apparently at the will of the transcendent consciousness that does not exist).</blockquote><blockquote id="EFIOpz3-L">Metzinger’s naturalization of emotions and reduction of thought to epiphenomena functions, once again, to reify our existing ideology; more troubling yet, it suggests that only imprecise and inadequate ideas are motivating and “true” ideas, and therefore that we can only be motivated by an ideology which distorts reality.</blockquote><blockquote id="IJRBlYv0o">The mistaken belief that we have a private consciousness which is not at all socially constructed is a central error of capitalist social formations, leading to frustration and suffering in our everyday lives.</blockquote></div></section></article></html>
