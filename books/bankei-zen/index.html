So, pondering over things is useless, isnâ€™t it?</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>â€œWith people who are clever, there are sure to be a great many shortcomings. To have transcended those clever people whom all the world holds in great esteem is whatâ€™s meant by â€˜stupidity.â€™ Thereâ€™s really nothing wrong with being a blockhead!</blockquote><div class="indent"></div><blockquote>The participants divided themselves among the halls, where they practiced either zazen or chanting. Without setting up any rules, each person just naturally pursued his own activity, practicing diligently and quietly so that it seemed as if there were no one in the room.</blockquote><blockquote>These days, the Zen monasteries everywhere crowd together three or five hundred monks, regulating their schedule down to the minute, restricting their area of movement, virtually binding them hand and foot so that itâ€™s just like going into a jail. If anyone commits even the slightest infraction, they beat him and throw him out, never showing the smallest forgiveness. Their prying and bullying are worse than a government officialâ€™s!</blockquote><div class="indent"></div></div></section><section class="mt-2"><h2>References</h2><ul><li><div class="linkref"><h3><a href="/days/2021-03-05">March 5th, 2021</a></h3><div><p>From <a class="ref" href="/books/bankei-zen">ðŸ“™ Bankei Zen</a>:</p></div></div></li></ul></section></article></html>
